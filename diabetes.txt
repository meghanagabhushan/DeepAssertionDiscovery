Thyroid hormones induce several changes in whole body metabolism that are known to improve metabolic homeostasis. However, adverse side effects have prevented its use in the clinic. In view of the promising effects of thyroid hormones, we investigated the effects of levothyroxine supplementation in glucose.
Young patients with advanced interstitial lung disease (ILD) are potential candidates for cadaveric lung transplantation. This study aimed to examine clinical features, outcomes, and prognostic factors in Japanese ILD patients awaiting lung transplantation.
The reasons for the increased risk of gestational diabetes among South Asian women are not well understood. We sought to identify the determinants of gestational diabetes and its impact on newborn health in a prospective birth cohort of South Asian women and their babies.
The present investigation was carried out to evaluate the reduction potential of aqueous extract of casing of pods of phaseolus vulgaris in blood glucose and lipids levels among hyperglycemic streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rats. Oral administration of 150mg/kg of aqueous oral administration of aqueous pod extract of phaseolus vulgaris to diabetic rats for 40days resulted in a significant decrease in blood glucose (p<001), cholesterol (P<0.01) and triglycerides (P<0.01). In addition, glibenclamide reduced blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. It is concluded that both aqueous extract of casing of pods of phaseolus vulgaris and glibenclamide reduced the blood levels of glucose and lipids. In addition, aqueous extract of phaseolus vulgaris pods was more effective than glibenclamide in reducing blood glucose.
The aim of the present study was to investigate predictors of atypical antipsychotic (AAP) treatment continuation and response by week 8 in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who have psychotic/aggressive symptoms using the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) dataset.
Animal models of dementia associated with metabolic abnormalities play an important role in understanding the bidirectional relationships between these pathologies. Rodent strains develop cognitive dysfunctions without alteration of peripheral metabolism following intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (icv-STZ).
American Indians have some of the highest rates of diabetes worldwide, and they are disproportionately affected by the secondary complications of the disease. While most research on Native populations focuses on reservations, this study investigates diabetes care in Chicago's Native community. People living with diabetes manage blood sugar levels to prevent the development of secondary complications. As with many diabetics, the majority of their health care work is completed outside of the biomedical setting. In this article, I explore how, in a community facing epidemic rates of disease, care is enmeshed in the everyday lives of not just those living with the disease but also significant others. As care in this context is accomplished across multiple spheres, from inside individual households to community-wide considerations, Chicago's intertribal community ties are strengthened. Care, in this sense, becomes a (perhaps tragic) means of Native American community building tied to cultural identity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) burden and duration are predictors of thromboembolic events. The random nature of these measures may affect clinical decision making. The objective of this study was to determine temporal changes in AF burden as detected by continuous monitoring.
The ABCC1 gene is structurally and functionally related to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Upregulation of ABCC1 is thought to improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF); the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. We analyzed the ABCC1 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs504348), plasma-induced ABCC1 mRNA expression levels, and ABCC1 methylation status and their correlation with clinical variables among CF subjects with differing CFTR mutations. We assigned 93 CF subjects into disease severity groups and genotyped SNP rs504348. For 23 CF subjects and 7 healthy controls, donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with plasma underwent gene expression analysis via qRT-PCR. ABCC1 promoter methylation was analyzed in the same 23 CF subjects. No significant correlation was observed between rs504348 genotypes and CF disease severity, but pancreatic insufficient CF subjects showed increased colonization with any form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR = 3.125, 95% CI: 1.192-8.190) and mucoid P. aeruginosa (OR = 5.075, 95% CI: 1.307-28.620) compared to the pancreatic sufficient group. A significantly higher expression of ABCC1 mRNA was induced by CF plasma compared to healthy control plasma (p < 0.001). CF subjects with rs504348 (CC/CG) also had higher mRNA expression compared to those with the ancestral GG genotype (p < 0.005). ABCC1 promoter was completely unmethylated; therefore, we did not detect any association between methylation and CF disease severity. In silico predictions suggested that histone modifications are crucial for regulating ABCC1 expression in PBMCs. Our results suggest that ABCC1 expression has a role in CFTR activity thereby increasing our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the clinical heterogeneity in CF.
Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are key risk factors for chronic disease. Dietary patterns are critical in the incidence and persistence of obesity and MetS, yet there is few data linking diet to obesity and MetS in Chile. Our objective was to use a locally validated diet index to evaluate adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and its correlations with overweight/obesity (OW/O) and MetS prevalence in Chilean adults. We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional online survey of Chilean adults with complete self-reported diet and body mass index data (n = 24,882). A subsample of 4348 users (17.5%) had valid MetS data. An inverse association was observed between adherence to Mediterranean diet and OW/O and MetS prevalence. As diet quality decreased from healthy, to moderately-healthy, to unhealthy, prevalence increased from 44.8, 51.1, to 60.9% for OW/O and from 13.4, 18.5, to 28.9% for MetS (p-values < 0.001). Adjusted odds ratios for OW/O and MetS were significantly higher in moderately-healthy (OR = 1.58 and 1.54) and unhealthy (OR = 2.20 and 2.49, respectively) diet groups in comparison to the healthy diet group. This study represents the first report on the relationship between Mediterranean diet and chronic disease risk in Chile. It suggests that the Mediterranean diet may be applied to manage chronic disease risk beyond the Mediterranean basin.
Lafora disease (LD, OMIM #254780) is a rare, recessively inherited neurodegenerative disease with adolescent onset, resulting in progressive myoclonus epilepsy which is fatal usually within ten years of symptom onset. The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in either of the two genes EPM2A (laforin) or EPM2B (malin). It characteristically involves the accumulation of insoluble glycogen-derived particles, named Lafora bodies (LBs), which are considered neurotoxic and causative of the disease. The pathogenesis of LD is therefore centred on the question of how insoluble LBs emerge from soluble glycogen. Recent data clearly show that an abnormal glycogen chain length distribution, but neither hyperphosphorylation nor impairment of general autophagy, strictly correlates with glycogen accumulation and the presence of LBs. This review summarizes results obtained with patients, mouse models, and cell lines and consolidates apparent paradoxes in the LD literature. Based on the growing body of evidence, it proposes that LD is predominantly caused by an impairment in chain-length regulation affecting only a small proportion of the cellular glycogen. A better grasp of LD pathogenesis will further develop our understanding of glycogen metabolism and structure. It will also facilitate the development of clinical interventions that appropriately target the underlying cause of LD.
The gold standard for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes is the measurement of fasting plasma glucose and the oral glucose tolerance test. The objective of this systematic review is to identify all alternative tests currently in use for the diagnosis of type 2 pre-diabetes mellitus in children and establish their accuracy relative to this gold standard.
We examined the associations between blood pressure indices (SBP, DBP, mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among persons with or without diabetes mellitus (NON-DM) in a multiethnic cohort.
Mechanisms underlying the central regulation of food intake and fat accumulation are not fully understood. We found that neurosecretory protein GL (NPGL), a newly-identified neuropeptide, increased food intake and white adipose tissue (WAT) in rats. NPGL-precursor gene overexpression in the hypothalamus caused increases in food intake, WAT, body mass, and circulating insulin when fed a high calorie diet. Intracerebroventricular administration of NPGL induced de novo lipogenesis in WAT, increased insulin, and it selectively induced carbohydrate intake. Neutralizing antibody administration decreased the size of lipid droplets in WAT. Npgl mRNA expression was upregulated by fasting and low insulin levels. Additionally, NPGL-producing cells were responsive to insulin. These results point to NPGL as a novel neuronal regulator that drives food intake and fat deposition through de novo lipogenesis and acts to maintain steady-state fat level in concert with insulin. Dysregulation of NPGL may be a root cause of obesity.
In Massachusetts, the number of opioid-related deaths has increased 350% since 2000. In the setting of increasing overdose deaths, one potential intervention is Supervised Injection Facilities (SIFs). This study explores willingness of people who inject drugs in Boston to use a SIF and examines factors associated with willingness.
Cytokines are small secreted proteins released by different types of cells with specific effects on cellular signaling and communication via binding to their receptors on the cell surface. IL-10 is known to be a pleiotropic and potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine that is produced by both innate and adaptive immunity cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, natural killer cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, B cells, CD8(+) T cells, and TH1, TH2, and TH17 and regulatory T cells. Both direct and indirect activation of the stress axis promotes IL-10 secretion. IL-10 deregulation plays a role in the development of a large number of inflammatory diseases such as neuropathic pain, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and allergy. Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory compound able to induce the expression and production of IL-10 and enhancing its action on a large number of tissues. In vitro and in pre-clinical models curcumin is able to modulate the disease pathophysiology of conditions such as pain and neurodegenerative diseases, bowel inflammation, and allergy, but also of infections and cancer through its effect on IL-10 secretion. In humans, at least one part of the positive effects of curcumin on health could be related to its ability to enhance IL-10 -mediated effects.
The goal of this study was to estimate the association between use of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among commercially insured children and young adults 6-24 years compared to users of non-SGA psychotropic medications.
A global non-targeted longitudinal metabolomics study was carried out in male and female NOD mice to characterize the time-profile of the changes in the metabolic signature caused by onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and identify possible early biomarkers in T1D progressors. Metabolomics profiling of samples collected at five different time-points identified 676 and 706 biochemicals in blood and feces, respectively. Several metabolites were expressed at significantly different levels in progressors at all time-points, and their proportion increased strongly following onset of hyperglycemia. At the last time-point, when all progressors were diabetic, a large percentage of metabolites had significantly different levels: 57.8% in blood and 27.8% in feces. Metabolic pathways most strongly affected included the carbohydrate, lipid, branched-chain amino acid, and oxidative ones. Several biochemicals showed considerable (>4�) change. Maltose, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and kojibiose increased, while 1,5-anhydroglucitol decreased more than 10-fold. At the earliest time-point (6-week), differences between the metabolic signatures of progressors and non-progressors were relatively modest. Nevertheless, several compounds had significantly different levels and show promise as possible early T1D biomarkers. They include fatty acid phosphocholine derivatives from the phosphatidylcholine sub-pathway (elevated in both blood and feces) as well as serotonin, ribose, and arabinose (increased) in blood plus 13-HODE, tocopherol (increased), diaminopimelate, valerate, hydroxymethylpyrimidine, and dulcitol (decreased) in feces. A combined metabolic signature based on these compounds might serve as an early predictor of T1D-progressors.
PurposeTo analyze the relation between ophthalmologic and motor changes in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7).Patients and methodsThis was a case series study. Sixteen SCA7 patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including ocular extrinsic motility testing, color vision test, and optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve and macula. Changes in the corneal endothelium, electroretinographic patterns, and a complete neurologic evaluation using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) were evaluated. Correlations of endothelial cell density (ECD) with number of CAG repetitions and the SARA scores were estimated.ResultsAll patients showed various degrees of visual impairment mainly due to macular deterioration. Notably, they also presented decreased ECD. Pairwise correlations of ECD with number of CAG repeats and severity of motor symptoms quantified with the SARA scores were inverse (r=-0.46, P=0.083 and r=-0.64, P=0.009, respectively). Further analyses indicated an average ECD decrease of 48 cells/mm(2) (P=0.006) per unit of change on the number of CAG repeats, and of 75 cells/mm(2) (P=0.001) per unit of change on the SARA scores.ConclusionsThe results agree with previous ophthalmological findings regarding the widespread effect of SCA7 mutation on the patient's visual system. However, the results also show a significant negative correlation of decreased ECD with both CAG repetitions and SARA scores. This suggests that motor systems could degenerate in parallel with visual systems, although more research is needed to determine whether the degeneration is caused by the same mechanisms.Eye advance online publication, 11 August 2017; doi:10.1038/eye.2017.135.
Direct Antiviral Agents (DAA) demonstrated high efficacy among HCV-infected patients in registered trials. Nevertheless, the impact of these therapies on liver stiffness measurement(LSM) and liver functionality in "real-life" is not well-known. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the SVR impact on LSM and clinical parameters of DAA-therapy on a real-life population of HCV patients with F3/F4 fibrosis.
This study aimed to test the association between dietary content of total and individual classes of polyphenols and incident cases of type 2 diabetes in Polish adults participating to the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe study. At baseline, diet by 148-item FFQ and health information were collected from 5806 participants free of diabetes. Self-reported incident type 2 diabetes was ascertained at 2-4-year follow-up visit. OR and 95 % CI of type 2 diabetes comparing the various categories of polyphenol intake to the lowest one (reference category) and as 1 sd increase modelled as continuous variable were calculated by performing age-, energy-, and multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models. During the follow-up, 456 incident cases of type 2 diabetes occurred. When comparing extreme quartiles, intake of total polyphenol was inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0�43; 95 % CI 0�30, 0�61); 1 sd increase was associated with a reduced risk of diabetes (OR 0�68; 95 % CI 0�59, 0�79). Among the main classes of polyphenols, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and stilbenes were independent contributors to this association. Both subclasses of phenolic acids were associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas among subclasses of flavonoids, high intake of flavanols, flavanones, flavones and anthocyanins was significantly associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Total dietary polyphenols and some classes of dietary polyphenols were associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
Obesity is a metabolic syndrome leading to several health problems such as hypertension, heart attack, type II diabetes, and even cancer. Carbonic anhydrase VA (CAVA) is a mitochondrial enzyme which is directly associated with the glucose homeostasis and considered as a promising target for obesity and other associated diseases in humans. So far, numerous inhibitors have been designed to inhibit the catalytic activity of CAVA with an assumption for its possible therapeutic uses against type II diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Among these, sulphonamide inhibitors and various non-classical inhibitors are extensively used. The focus of this review is to understand the mechanism and role CAVA in glucose homeostasis to ascertain as a potential drug target of obesity. We have further highlighted different types of inhibitors and their mode of binding and possible consequences with an aim to investigate possible therapeutic used for the treatment of obesity and associated diseases. Along with classical inhibitors, various non-classical inhibitors have proved to be potential inhibitors of CAV which may be employed to combat obesity. Certain phytochemicals are utilized as therapeutic molecules to fight obesity. These phytochemicals have been discussed in detail here.
Given the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in modern society, health care providers are frequently tasked with managing glucose control in the perioperative period. When determining perioperative diabetes management, the clinician must balance the need to maintain relative euglycemia at the time of surgery with preventing hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in a fasting surgical patient. This balance requires an understanding of the pharmacology of these medications, the type of surgery, and the patient's degree of diabetic control.
Several devices are available for liver parenchyma transection (LPT). The aim of this study was to compare the Ultracision Harmonic scalpel (UHS) with the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) among patients who underwent hemi-right hepatectomies (RH) to homogenize transection areas.
Purpose The purpose of this study was to describe Sub-Saharan African immigrants' health-illness transition experiences associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) self-management. Methods A qualitative description methodology was used in this study. Face-to-face semi-structured in-depth interviews lasting 60 to 90 minutes were conducted with 10 Sub-Saharan African immigrant men and women with T2DM recruited using purposive and snowball sampling. Each interview was audio-taped, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results Participants' mean age was 60.3 years (range, 44-76 years), 5 men and 5 women; most had lived in the US for more than 10 years (70%) and with T2DM for more than 5 years (60%). Four overarching domains described the health-illness transition experiences the participants had with T2DM self-management: (1) knowledge of T2DM self-management behaviors, (2) current T2DM self-management behaviors, (3) inhibitors of T2DM self-management, and (4) facilitators of T2DM self-management. Conclusions Health professionals should be equipped with an understanding of the properties and conditions of health-illness transition. This understanding is necessary to build a foundation that facilitates healthy adaptation to the T2DM transition requiring the development and mastery of new skills consistent with gaining control of T2DM. Culturally tailored interventions need to be developed to decrease inhibitors of and encourage self-management in daily T2DM care for Sub-Saharan African immigrants with T2DM.
The objectives for this study were to examine the associations between metabolic biomarkers of obesity including insulin resistance, vascular dysfunction, systemic inflammation, genetic susceptibility and ultrasound proven gallstone disease or cholecystectomy in a population-based cross-sectional study.
To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of the fixed-dose combination of insulin degludec and the glucagon-like peptide-I receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), liraglutide (IDegLira) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a small incretin hormone stimulated by food intake, resulting in an amplification of the insulin response. Though interesting as a drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, its short plasma half-life of less than 3 minutes limits its clinical use. A strategy to extend the half-life of GLP-1 utilizes the long half-life of human serum albumin (HSA) by combining the two via chemical conjugation or genetic fusion. HSA has a plasma half-life of around 21 days owing to its interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expressed in endothelial cells of blood vessels, which rescues circulating HSA from lysosomal degradation. We have conjugated GLP-1 to C34 of native sequence recombinant HSA (rHSA) and two rHSA variants; one with increased and one with decreased binding affinity to hFcRn. We have investigated the impact of conjugation on FcRn binding affinities, GLP-1 potency and pharmacokinetics, combined with the solution structure of the rHSA variants and GLP-1 albumin conjugates. The solution structures, determined by small angle X-ray scattering, show the GLP-1 pointing away from the surface of rHSA. Combining the solution structures with the available structural information on the FcRn and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) obtained from X-ray crystallography, we can explain the observed in-vitro and in-vivo behaviour. We conclude that the conjugation of GLP-1 to rHSA does not affect the interaction between rHSA and FcRn, while the observed decrease in the potency of GLP-1 can be explained by a steric hindrance of GLP-1 binding to its receptor.
An 18 year old male, known case of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus was admitted in view of diabetic ketoacidosis. With normalization of blood sugars patient developed gross reddish discoloration of urine. Urine routine microscopy did not reveal RBCs or RBC casts. Peripheral blood smear revealed bite cells, Heinz bodies and spherocytes. Thus a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia with hemoglobinuria was made. Patient's glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) levels were below the normal range. G6PD, an enzyme of the HMP shunt, is the most common enzyme defect causing hemolytic anemia. G6PD deficiency related hemolytic crisis is most commonly precipitated by infection, drugs or fava beans. Its association with DKA has been seldom reported.
Depression is one of the most common chronic mental illnesses globally and in India. It has been reported that depression is twice as common in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of both depression and type 2 diabetes are rapidly increasing. This article reviews the prevalence of depression in the general population as well as in patients with type 2 diabetes and its complications with special reference to recent data from India. It also makes a case for screening for depression in diabetes clinics and integrating depression treatment with diabetes care in order to make the treatment more wholistic.
To compare the bias, absolute bias, precision and accuracies between the equations, viz., CKD-EPI (Scr), CKD-EPI (Scys) and MDRD in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes.
Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) is a newly introduced Glucose Monitoring system. FGM provides both graphical representation of qualitative and quantitative changes in glucose levels occurring over 14-day period collapsed into single modal day graph as well as day by day graphs. In this report, we present our experience with FGM in different clinical situations. In our experience FGM is an extremely useful clinical tool for detection of glucose variability, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. It can also be used as an effective educational tool when the data from FGM is shared with the patient. This helps in motivating the patient in achieving better glycemic control.
Psychological comorbidity, such as depression and/or diabetes-specific emotional distress (diabetes distress), is widespread in people with Type 2 diabetes and is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. Although extensive research into the prevalence of depression has been conducted, the same attention has not been given to diabetes distress. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the overall prevalence of diabetes distress in people with Type 2 diabetes.
To investigate the role of self-compassion in diabetes outcomes, a construct which may be relevant to chronic conditions, given its focus on compassion toward oneself, especially in times of difficulty.
Recently, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin, a major anti-hyperglycaemic agent, has received substantial attention as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases via enhancing the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). However, the direct effects of sitagliptin on EPC function remain elusive. In this study, we evaluated the proangiogenic effects of sitagliptin on a diabetic hind limb ischaemia (HLI) model in�vivo and on EPC culture in�vitro. Treatment of db/db mice with sitagliptin (Januvia) after HLI surgery efficiently enhanced ischaemic angiogenesis and blood perfusion, which was accompanied by significant increases in circulating EPC numbers. EPCs derived from the bone marrow of normal mice were treated with high glucose to mimic diabetic hyperglycaemia. We found that high glucose treatment induced EPC apoptosis and tube formation impairment, which were significantly prevented by sitagliptin pretreatment. A mechanistic study found that high glucose treatment of EPCs induced dramatic increases in oxidative stress and apoptosis; pretreatment of EPCs with sitagliptin significantly attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis, tube formation impairment and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that sitagliptin restored the basal autophagy of EPCs that was impaired by high glucose via activating the AMP-activated protein kinase/unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 signalling pathway, although an autophagy inhibitor abolished the protective effects of sitagliptin on EPCs. Altogether, the results indicate that sitagliptin-induced preservation of EPC angiogenic function results in an improvement of diabetic ischaemia angiogenesis and blood perfusion, which are most likely mediated by sitagliptin-induced prevention of EPC apoptosis via augmenting autophagy.
In 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII, insulin pump therapy) for people with Type�1 diabetes was published [1]. Implementation of this enables children under the age of 12 years to access CSII, and consideration of CSII for adults and children over 12 years with challenging hypo- or hyperglycaemia. In Scotland, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidance for management of diabetes states that CSII therapy should be considered for people unable to achieve their glycaemic targets, for those who experience recurring episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, and in infants and very young children with very low basal insulin requirements, for whom even small doses of basal insulin analogue may result in hypoglycaemia [2]. In both documents, CSII should be provided in a specialist centre and is an adjunct to structured education. Since these guidelines were implemented insulin pump uptake in England has increased with 11.7% of people with Type 1 diabetes attending participating specialist services treated with an insulin pump in 2015 [3] and this number expected to rise over time.

This study aimed to describe and compare refill adherence and persistence to lipid-lowering medicines in patients with type 2 diabetes by previous cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Diabetes is a stronger risk factor for acute coronary syndrome for women than men. We investigate whether behavioural and psychosocial factors contribute to the disparity in acute coronary syndrome risk and outcomes among women with diabetes relative to women without diabetes and men.
To assess the lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, in people with hypercholesterolaemia and prediabetes at baseline vs people with normoglycaemia at baseline in a pooled analysis of 10 ODYSSEY phase III trials.
To describe clinical aspects of dogs with punctate retinal hemorrhage (PRH).
Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves a multidisciplinary approach comprising medical management and sometimes surgery. Although diet is central to IBD management, the optimal diet for patients with IBD is uncertain. A UK collaborative partnership within the James Lind Alliance was set up between patients, clinicians and other stakeholders to develop research priorities in IBD. The aim of this short report is to provide a comprehensive summary of the research priority findings relating to diet in the treatment of IBD.
Infants born to mothers with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of congenital anomalies, perinatal mortality and significant morbidity in the short and long term. Pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes are at greater risk of perinatal morbidity and diabetic complications. The relationship between glycaemic control and health outcomes for both mothers and infants indicates the potential for preconception care for these women to be of benefit. This is an update of the original review, which was first published in 2010.
This paper seeks to summarize the impact of the one-step International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) versus the two-step gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) criteria with regard to prevalence, outcomes, healthcare delivery, and long-term maternal metabolic risk.
Cancer health literacy, which is the ability to search, understand, and use health information to make appropriate health decisions, plays an important role in the use of preventative and screening information. The present study aims to evaluate cervical cancer health literacy in women of reproductive age and its related factors. In this cross-sectional study, 231 women of reproductive age who referred to health centers of Khuzestan Province, Iran, were selected via convenience sampling. A valid and reliable measure was employed to collect information about various dimensions of cervical cancer health literacy, including having access to, reading, understanding, appraising, using, and communicating it. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS 16. Data analysis was conducted by independent sample t test, one-way ANOVA, Spearman's correlation, chi-square, and linear regression. The participants' average health literacy score was 97.88���12.7 (from 135 points), and 47.2% of the participants had limited health literacy. Health literacy was associated with education, employment, income, searching, mothers' and young friends' counseling, and duration of the study time (p�<�0.05). In linear regression model, there was a significant association between income (p�=�0.011), searching (p�=�0.01), study time (p�=�0.009), and young friends' counseling (p�=�0.002) and cervical cancer literacy scores. In this study, no significant association was observed between age and health literacy. This study indicated that the cervical cancer literacy in women of reproductive age was not at good levels. Health workers should pay more attention to groups who are at greater risk of having low health literacy. Moreover, targeting and tailoring educational interventions with respect to different levels of cervical cancer literacy might increase cervical cancer screening.
Despite size and relevance of uncontrolled diabetes, robust evidence on its effects on health care utilisation is very limited, especially among European countries. We employed longitudinal administrative data from Spain (2004-2010) to explore the relationship between uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and health care utilisation. We used a biomarker (glycated haemoglobin, HbA1c) to detect the presence of uncontrolled diabetes and explore its effects on both primary and secondary health care. We estimated a range of panel count data models, including negative binomials with random effects, dynamic and hurdle specifications to account for unobserved heterogeneity, previous utilisation and selection. We found uncontrolled diabetes in between 27 and 30% of patients of both genders. Our estimates suggested that although women appeared to systematically consume more health care compared to men, their consumption levels did not seem to be influenced by uncontrolled diabetes. Conversely, among men uncontrolled diabetes increased the average number of GP visits per year by between 3 and 3.4%, specialist visits by 5.3-6.1%, depending on specifications, and also extended annual hospital length of stay by 15%. We also found some evidence of heterogeneity in utilisation based on the level of uncontrolled diabetes among male individuals. Overall, our results suggested the need for different diabetes management plans depending on gender and levels of glycaemic control.
Bariatric surgery is an effective intervention for the majority of patients with morbid obesity, but a significant minority fails to achieve substantial weight loss. In the search of possible predictors of weight loss following bariatric surgery, preoperative factors turn out to have limited predictive power. This study will examine the impact of two postoperative factors on weight loss: perceived social support and stressful life events.
Hydrolysates and peptide fractions (PF) obtained from sea cucumber with commercial enzyme were studied on the hyperglycemic and renal protective effects on db/db rats using urine metabolomics. Compared with the control group the polypeptides from the two species could significantly reduce the urine glucose and urea. We also tried to address the compositions of highly expressed urinary proteins using a proteomics approach. They were serum albumins, AMBP proteins, negative trypsin, elastase, and urinary protein, GAPDH, a receptor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR), and Ig kappa chain C region. We used the electronic nose to quickly detect changes in the volatile substances in mice urine after holothurian polypeptides (HPP) fed, and the results show it can identify the difference between treatment groups with the control group without overlapping. The protein express mechanism of HPP treating diabetes was discussed, and we suggested these two peptides with the hypoglycemic and renal protective activity might be utilized as nutraceuticals.
There is conflicting data on the effect of HIV infection as well as antiretroviral therapy (ART) on pregnancy outcome. The objectives of this study were to compare pregnancy outcomes in women with and without HIV infection, and to evaluate the effect of HAART on pregnancy in HIV-infected women.
A 46-year-old Caucasian male has been transferred to our urology department with a history of septic fever, uncompensated diabetes, pain, and scrotal swelling. On clinical examination, the left inguinal and scrotal area was swollen, tender, and painful; scrotal MR had been performed, showing the catheter tip in scrotal cavity and presence of gas. The case was diagnosed as scrotal abscess with urethroscrotal fistula. He was successfully treated with scrotal incision, drainage, catheter repositioning under fluoroscopic control, antibiotics, and insulin. This patient developed an infection of scrotum, which led to subcutaneous abscess getting worse by a poorly controlled glycemia. In this case, an iatrogenic fistula, caused by wrong catheterization, stops the evolving to a Fournier's Gangrene. Early detection and intervention provide opportunities to improve outcome of this disease.
Treating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has an impact on improving long-term outcome. However, patients with other comorbidities are challenging, and are considered as a high-risk population.
A significant drawback of the exogenous administration of insulin to diabetics is the non-physiological profile of insulin action resulting in the insufficient suppression of hepatic glucose production, which is the main contributing factor to diabetic hyperglycemia under fasting conditions and the basis of the challenge to restore a more physiological glucose profile in diabetes. The insulin receptor (IR) exists in two alternatively spliced variants, IR-A and IR-B, with different tissue distribution. While peripheral tissues contain different proportions of both isoforms, hepatic cells almost exclusively contain IR-B. In this respect, IR-B-selective insulin analogs would be of great interest for their potential to restore more natural metabolic homeostasis in diabetes. Recent advances in the structural biology of insulin and IR have provided new clues for understanding the interaction of both proteins. This article discusses and offers some structural perspectives for the design of specific insulin analogs with a preferential binding to IR-B.
Maternal diabetes is known to cause neural tube defects (NTDs) in embryos and neuropsychological deficits in infants. Several metabolic pathways and a plethora of genes have been identified to be deregulated in developing brain of embryos by maternal diabetes, although the exact mechanism remains unknown. Recently, miRNAs have been shown to regulate genes involved in brain development and maturation. Therefore, we hypothesized that maternal diabetes alters the expression of miRNAs that regulate genes involved in biological pathways critical for neural tube development and closure during embryogenesis. To address this, high throughput miRNA expression profiling in neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from the forebrain of embryos from normal or streptozotocin-induced diabetic pregnancy was carried out. It is known that maternal diabetes results in fetal hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia or hypoxia. Hence, NSCs from embryos of control pregnant mice were exposed to low or high glucose or hypoxia in vitro. miRNA pathway analysis revealed distinct deregulation of several biological pathways, including axon guidance pathway, which are critical for brain development in NSCs exposed to different treatments. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, the miRNA-30 family members which are predicted to target genes involved in brain development was upregulated in NSCs from embryos of diabetic pregnancy when compared to control. miRNA-30b was found to be upregulated while its target gene Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), as revealed by luciferase assay, was down regulated in NSCs from embryos of diabetic pregnancy. Further, overexpression of miRNA-30b in NSCs, resulted in decreased expression of Sirt1 protein, and altered the neuron/glia ratio. On the other hand, siRNA mediated knockdown of Sirt1 in NSCs promoted astrogenesis, indicating that miRNA-30b alters lineage specification via Sirt1. Overall, these results suggest that maternal diabetes alters the genes involved in neural tube formation via regulating miRNAs.
Chronic wounds, in particular venous leg ulcers (VLU), represent a substantial burden for economies, healthcare systems and societies worldwide. This burden is exacerbated by the recalcitrant nature of these wounds, despite best practice, evidence-based care, which substantially reduces the quality of life of patients. Furthermore, co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease within ageing populations further contribute to the increasing prevalence in developed countries. This review provides an overview of the literature concerning the cellular and molecular mechanisms of wound healing and aspects where this process fails, resulting in a chronic wound. VLU may arise from chronic venous disease, which presents with many clinical manifestations and can lead to a highly complex disease state. Efforts to comprehend this state using various omics based approaches have delivered some insight into the underlying biology of chronic wounds and revealed markers of differentiation at the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic levels. Furthermore, this review outlines the array of analytical tools and approaches that have been utilised for capturing multivariate data at each of these molecular levels. Future developments in spatiotemporal analysis of wounds along with the integration of multiple omics datasets may provide much needed information on the key molecules that drive wound chronicity. Such biomarkers have the potential to be developed into clinically relevant diagnostic tools to aid in personalised wound management.
Mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) and their analogs have emerged as wide-spectrum, stress response factors protective in amyloid disease models. MDP cytoprotective functions are generally attributed to anti-apoptotic activity, however, little is known about their capacity to facilitate the cell's unfolded protein response via direct interactions with amyloidogenic proteins. Here, we explored the effects of the MDP-analog, humaninS14G (HNG), and the MDP, small humanin-like peptide 2 (SHLP2), on the misfolding of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a critical pathogenic step in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our thioflavin T fluorescence studies show that HNG inhibits IAPP misfolding at highly substoichiometric concentrations. Seeded fluorescence and co-sedimentation studies demonstrate MDPs block amyloid seeding and directly bind misfolded, seeding-capable IAPP species. Furthermore, our electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and circular dichroism data indicate MDPs do not act by binding IAPP monomers. Taken together our results reveal a novel chaperone-like activity wherein these MDPs specifically target misfolded amyloid seeds to inhibit IAPP misfolding which, along with direct anti-apoptotic activity and beneficial metabolic effects, make HNG and SHLP2 exciting prospects as T2DM therapeutics. These data also suggest that other mitochondrial stress response factors within the MDP family may be amenable to development into therapeutics for protein-misfolding diseases.
Recent studies showed many cirrhosis patients may have diabetes mellitus (DM), however, the effect of DM on brain in cirrhotic patients is unclear. This study included 34 cirrhosis patients (17 with DM, 17 without DM) and 17 age-, sex-matched healthy controls. MRI examination and neuropsychological tests were performed. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and voxel-based morphometry algorithms were used to obtain fALFF values and gray matter volume, which were compared and correlated with clinical variables. In cirrhosis patients with and without DM, fALFF values were decreased in the left postcentral gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, bilateral lingual gyri and occipital lobe, while increased in the left orbital frontal gyrus. Gray matter volume was decreased in bilateral caudates and putamen, while increased in bilateral thalami. Compared with non-DM cirrhosis patients, DM cirrhosis patients showed decreased fALFF values in bilateral caudates and decreased gray matter volume in bilateral thalami. The blood glucose levels of cirrhosis patients showed negative correlations with fALFF values in bilateral caudates and gray matter volume in bilateral thalami. In conclusion, DM aggravates brain damage in cirrhosis patients. Thus, it is important to pay more attention to the management of DM in cirrhotic patients.
Metabolism is of central importance to T cell survival and differentiation. It is well known that T cells cannot function in the absence of glucose, but it is less clear how they respond to excessive levels of glucose. In this study we investigated how increasing levels of glucose affect T cell-mediated immune responses. We examined the effects of increased levels of glucose on CD8(+) T cell behaviour in vitro by assessing activation and cytokine production, as well as oxygen consumption rate, extracellular acidification rate and intracellular signalling. In addition, we assessed in vivo proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity of cells in chemically induced diabetic C57BL6 mice. Elevated levels of glucose in in vitro cultures had modest effects on proliferation and cytokine production, while in vivo hyperglycemia had no effect on CD8(+) T cell proliferation, interferon gamma production or cytolytic killing.
It has been shown that adipose tissue and skeletal muscles of lean individuals respond to meal-induced hyperinsulinemia by increases in perfusion, the effect not observed in patients with metabolic syndrome. In conditions of hyperglycaemia and hypertriglyceridemia, this insufficient vascularization leads to the liberation of reactive oxygen species, and disruption of nitric oxide synthesis and endothelial signalling responsible for the uptake of circulating fatty acids, whose accumulation in skeletal muscles and adipose tissue is widely associated with impairment of insulin signalling. While the angiogenic role of VEGF-A and its increased circulating concentrations in obesity have been widely confirmed, the data related to the metabolic role of VEGF-B are diverse. However, recent discoveries indicate that this growth factor may be a promising therapeutic agent in patients with metabolic syndrome. Preclinical studies agree over two crucial metabolic effects of VEGF-B: a) regulation of fatty acids uptake and b) regulation of tissue perfusion via activation of VEGF-A/VEGFR2 pathway. While in some preclinical high-fat diet studies VEGF-B overexpression reverted glucose intolerance and stimulated fat burning, in others it furtherly promoted accumulation of lipids and lipotoxicity. Data from clinical studies point out the changes in circulating or tissue expression levels of VEGF-B in obese versus lean patients. Potentially beneficial effects of VEGF-B, achieved through enhanced blood flow (increased availability of insulin and glucose uptake in target organs) and decreased fatty acids uptake (prevention of lipotoxicity and improved insulin signalling), and its safety for clinical use, remain to be clarified through future translational research.
Little is known about vision impairment and frailty in older age. We investigated the relationship of poor vision and incident prefrailty and frailty.
Obesity is an independent risk factor for stroke, though several clinical studies have reported that obesity improves stroke outcome. Obesity is hypothesised to aid recovery by protecting against post-stroke catabolism. We therefore assessed whether obese mice had an altered metabolic and inflammatory response to stroke. Obese ob/ob mice underwent 20 min middle cerebral artery occlusion and 24 h reperfusion. Lipid metabolism and expression of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in the plasma, liver and adipose tissue. The obese-specific metabolic response to stroke was assessed in plasma using non-targeted UPLC-MS metabolomics coupled with univariate and multivariate analysis. Obesity had no effect on the extent of weight loss 24 h after stroke but affected the metabolic and inflammatory responses to stroke, predominantly affecting lipid metabolism. Specifically, obese mice had increases in plasma free fatty acids and expression of adipose lipolytic enzymes. Metabolomics identified several classes of metabolites affected by stroke in obese mice, including fatty acids and membrane lipids (glycerophospholipids, lysophospholipids and sphingolipids). Obesity also featured increases in inflammatory cytokines in the plasma and adipose tissue. Overall these results demonstrate that obesity affected the acute metabolic and inflammatory response to stroke and suggest a potential role for adipose tissue in this effect. These findings could have implications for longer-term recovery and also further highlight the importance of considering comorbidities in preclinical stroke research, especially when identifying biomarkers for stroke. However, further work is required to assess whether these changes translate into long-term effects on recovery.
The Kelly West Award for Outstanding Achievement in Epidemiology is given in memory of Kelly M.

He presented the Kelly West Award Lecture, "Changing Tides of the Type 2 Diabetes Epidemic-Smooth Sailing or Troubled Waters Ahead?" on Sunday, 12 June 2016.
To investigate the association of falling insulin requirements (FIR) among women with pre-existing diabetes with adverse obstetric outcomes and maternal biomarkers longitudinally in pregnancy.
During healthy pregnancy, the cardiovascular system undergoes diverse adaptations to support adequate transfer of oxygen and nutrients from mother to fetus. In order to accommodate the large expansion of blood volume and associated cardiac output, the structure, mechanics, and function of the arteries are altered. Specifically, in healthy pregnancy there is a remodeling of arteries (increased angiogenesis and vasodilation), a generalized reduction in arterial stiffness (increased compliance), and an enhanced endothelial function. The development of pregnancy complications, specifically pre-eclampsia, is associated with poor placentation (decreased angiogenesis), increased arterial stiffness, and vascular dysfunction (reduced endothelial function). Many of the positive adaptations that occur in healthy pregnancy are enhanced in response to chronic exercise. Specifically, placental angiogenesis and endothelial function have been shown to improve to a greater extent in women who are active during their pregnancy compared with those who are not. Prenatal exercise may be important in helping to reduce the risk of vascular dysfunction in pregnancy. However, our knowledge of the vascular adaptations resulting from maternal exercise is limited. This review highlights maternal vascular adaptations occurring during healthy pregnancy, and contrasts the vascular maladaptation associated with pre-eclampsia. Finally, we discuss the role of prenatal exercise on vascular function in the potential prevention of vascular complications associated with pre-eclampsia.
Bayesian analysis is firmly grounded in the science of probability and has been increasingly supplementing or replacing traditional approaches based on P values. In this review, we present gradually more complex examples, along with programming code and data sets, to show how Bayesian analysis takes evidence from randomized clinical trials to update what is already known about specific treatments in cardiovascular medicine. In the example of revascularization choices for diabetic patients who have multivessel coronary artery disease, we combine the results of the FREEDOM trial (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) with prior probability distributions to show how strongly we should believe in the new Class I recommendation ("should be done") for a preference of bypass surgery over percutaneous coronary intervention. In the debate about the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation, we avoid a common pitfall in traditional meta-analysis and create a network of randomized clinical trials to compare outcomes after specific treatment durations. Although we find no credible increase in mortality, we affirm the tradeoff between increased bleeding and reduced myocardial infarctions with prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy, findings that support the new Class IIb recommendation ("may be considered") to extend dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation. In the decision between culprit artery-only and multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, we use hierarchical meta-analysis to analyze evidence from observational studies and randomized clinical trials and find that the probability of all-cause mortality at longest follow-up is similar after both strategies, a finding that challenges the older ban against noninfarct-artery intervention during primary percutaneous coronary intervention. These examples illustrate how Bayesian analysis integrates new trial information with existing knowledge to reduce uncertainty and change attitudes about treatments in cardiovascular medicine.
Disturbances in water and electrolyte homeostasis are common following transsphenoidal surgery. These disorders are variable and unpredictable, increasing patient risk and complicating postsurgical treatment. Clinically, it is generally accepted that damage to the pituitary is the etiology, but the mechanisms behind the response variability and underlying pathophysiology remains unknown.
Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) frequently serve more socio-economically disadvantaged populations; existing literature suggests that underserved groups are more likely to experience various chronic physical and mental health conditions. FQHC patients may have significant needs for various specialty services that are beyond common FQHC providers. This study examines chronic condition prevalence, healthcare satisfaction, and use of multiprovider services in a Midwest FQHC patient population. We also evaluated the potential of interprofessional collaborative practices in FQHC settings.
Routine food insecurity screening is recommended in diabetes care to inform more tailored interventions that better support diabetes self-management among food-insecure patients. This pilot study explored the acceptability and feasibility of a food insecurity screening initiative within a diabetes care setting in Toronto.
Superficial wound complications occur in up to 10% of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures and have been associated with periprosthetic joint infection. The ideal material for TKA closure should offer: 1) fast intraoperative application, 2) minimal wound complications and 3) removable by patients without assistance. We evaluated a novel, non-invasive, removable skin closure system for TKA to determine its effect on wound complications.
At our medical center, female patients who have undergone bariatric surgery are advised to defer pregnancy for 2 years after surgery to avoid the following complications and their potential consequences for the fetus: inadequate gestational weight gain, inadequate postsurgical weight loss, hyperemesis gravidarum, nutritional deficiencies, gestational diabetes, and gestational hypertension.
The aims of this population based study were to describe mid- to long-term amputation risk, cumulative incidence of death or amputation, and differences in pre-operative comorbidities in patients revascularised for lower limb peripheral artery disease (PAD).
Spinal epidural abscesses are uncommon but potentially devastating infections that often elude early diagnosis. An increasing incidence has been suggested; however, few contemporary data are available regarding risk factors and epidemiologic trends over time.
The relationship between the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and diabetes has been studied for many years. However, studies that assessed RAS components comprehensively were limited. We hypothesized that serum RAS components, especially the effector peptide angiotensin-II, might be closely associated with glucose metabolism status and diabetic complications.
Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the preferred therapy for patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We reviewed patients undergoing PCI for STEMI over a six-year period to evaluate changes in procedural characteristics and clinical outcomes given recent changes to STEMI guidelines.
Determine the mortality experience among adults with diabetes in meeting and not meeting less intense control for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), and cholesterol.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disorder and its treatment with only metformin often does not provide optimum glycemic control. Addition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2) will improve the glycemic control in patients on metformin alone. In this study, an attempt is made to investigate the combined therapy of SGLT-2 with metformin in managing T2DM in terms of lowering HbA1c and body weight and monotherapy using metformin alone in HbA1c and body weight reduction.
Diabetes mellitus (DM), a modern-day epidemic, is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is believed that statins elevate the risk of incident DM. Multiple trials were suggestive of the hyperglycemic effect of long-term statin use. This has prompted the Food and Drug Administration to include the risk of DM in the product label of statins. New-onset DM with statin use is biologically plausible and can be explained based on the multiple pathways in glucose metabolism affected by statins. Most pivotal clinical trials on statins were not powered to adequately assess the risk of incident DM with statin use, and the results from multiple meta-analyses are mixed. Currently, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor and a 10-year risk of >7.5%. With the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, the number of patients eligible for statin therapy has increased exponentially, which also calls for caution and increased vigilance in prescribing physicians regarding the controversies surrounding statin use. This article aims to highlight the existing data on statin use for primary prevention in diabetics and nondiabetics and the association of statins use with new-onset DM and its postulated mechanisms.
The association of transaortic flow rate (FR) with outcomes was tested in 1,661 patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS) in the SEAS (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis) study.
This study sought to determine the incidence and progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in�asymptomatic middle-aged subjects and to evaluate the value of a broad panel of biomarkers in the prediction of CAC growth.
This study sought to determine the possibility of interactions between coronary artery calcium (CAC) volume or CAC density with each other, and with age, sex, ethnicity, the new atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease�(ASCVD) risk score, diabetes status, and renal function by estimated glomerular filtration rate, and, using differing CAC scores, to determine the improvement over the ASCVD risk score in risk prediction and reclassification.
An 84-year-old man without a history of smoking presented with progressive dyspnea of 6�months' duration accompanied by fatigue and unintentional weight loss. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, hemoptysis, rash, joint pains, or muscle aches. He had multiple hospitalizations for similar presentations that were diagnosed as pneumonia. History was significant for diastolic heart failure, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Busy primary care providers are in the frontline and see the bulk of older adults with diabetes. This vulnerable population is more prone to diabetic complications and hypoglycemia. In contrast to the younger patients with diabetes, lifestyle interventions are even more effective in older adults while the target A1c levels may need to be more relaxed for frail individuals. Geriatric syndromes can adversely affect diabetes care. A team with experts in different fields who understand the needs of older adults is essential for the adequate quality care of the whole individual with diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common cause of death in T2D. Yet,�<50% of U.S. adults with T2D meet recommended guidelines for CVD prevention. The burden of T2D is increasing: by 2050, approximately 1 in 3 U.S. individuals may have T2D, and patients with T2D will comprise an increasingly large proportion of the CVD population. The authors believe it is imperative that we expand the use of therapies proven to reduce CVD risk in patients with T2D. The authors summarize evidence and guidelines for lifestyle (exercise, nutrition, and weight management) and CVD risk factor (blood pressure, cholesterol and blood lipids, glycemic�control, and the use of�aspirin) management for the prevention of CVD among patients with T2D. The authors believe appropriate lifestyle and CVD risk factor management has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of CVD�among�patients with T2D.
Clinical outcomes in large patient populations from real-world clinical practice with a next-generation self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve are lacking.
Currently, there is no generally accepted model to predict outcomes in stable coronary�heart�disease�(CHD).
Shared decision making is essential to patient centered care, but can be difficult for busy clinicians to implement into practice. Tools have been developed to aid in shared decision making and embedded in electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate use. This study was undertaken to explore the patterns of use and barriers and facilitators to use of two decision aids, the Statin Choice Decision Aid (SCDA) and the Diabetes Medication Choice Decision Aid (DMCDA), in primary care practices where the decision aids are embedded in the EMR.
Little is known on the magnitude and correlates of insulin resistance in HIV-infected people in Africa. We determined the prevalence of insulin resistance and investigated associated factors in HIV-infected adult Cameroonians.
Self-care practices among persons living with type-2 diabetes are very crucial in diabetes manages as poor self-care results in complications. However, little research exists within the Ghanaian context. This study examined whether type-2 diabetes patients' illness perception and diabetes knowledge significantly predict diabetes self-care practices.
The cause of adverse weekend clinical outcomes remains unknown. In 2013, the "NHS Services, Seven Days a Week" project was initiated to improve access to services across the seven-day week. Three years on, we sought to analyse the impact of such changes across the English NHS.
Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has improved immensely during the past decade but controversies persist on cardiovascular benefits among women with diabetes. We investigated 11-year trends in hospital admission rates for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in people with and without diabetes by gender in England.
Inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are important pathophysiological bases of the occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus (DM) and macroangiopathy complications. Selenoprotein S (SELENOS) is involved in the regulation of these mechanisms; therefore, its association with DM and macroangiopathy has gradually received attention from scholars worldwide. SELENOS has different biological functions in different tissues and organs: it exerts antioxidant protection and has anti-ER stress effects in the pancreas and blood vessels, while it promotes the occurrence and development of insulin resistance in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. In addition, studies have confirmed that some SELENOS gene polymorphisms can influence the inflammatory response and are closely associated with the risk for developing DM and macroangiopathy. Therefore, comprehensive understanding of the association between SELENOS and inflammation, oxidative stress, and ER stress may better elucidate and supplement the pathogenic mechanisms of DM and macroangiopathy complications. Furthermore, in-depth investigation of the association of SELENOS function in different tissues and organs with DM and macroangiopathy may facilitate the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of DM and macrovascular complications. Here, we summarize the consensus and controversy regarding functions of SELENOS on currently available evidence.
Though Illumina has largely dominated the RNA-Seq field, the simultaneous availability of Ion Torrent has left scientists wondering which platform is most effective for differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. Previous investigations of this question have typically used reference samples derived from cell lines and brain tissue, and do not involve biological variability. While these comparisons might inform studies of tissue-specific expression, marked by large-scale transcriptional differences, this is not the common use case.
Recent large scale meta-analysis of genome wide association studies (GWAS) from multiple cohorts, demonstrated the association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584, with processing speed (measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) or the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST)), at GWAS significance level. This SNP is located within the cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) gene. We aimed to validate this finding in our sample of 944 cognitively normal Jewish elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), a population which is at risk for cognitive decline and dementia.
Objective: To investigate the morbidity, diagnostic profile and perinatal outcome of pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) in 15 hospitals in Guangdong province. Methods: A total of 41 338 women delivered in the 15 hospitals during the 6 months, 195 women with PGDM (PGDM group) and 195 women with normal glucose test result (control group) were recruited from these tertiary hospitals in Guangdong province from January 2016 to June 2016. The morbidity and diagnostic profile of PGDM were analyzed. The complications during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were compared between the two groups. In the PGDM group, pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in women who used insulin treatment (n=91) and women who did not (n=104). Results: (1) The incidence of PGDM was 0.472%(195/41 338). Diabetes mellitus were diagnosed in 59 women (30.3%, 59/195) before pregnancy, and 136 women (69.7%,136/195) were diagnosed as PGDM after conceptions. Forty-six women (33.8%) were diagnosed by fasting glucose and glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) screening. (2) The maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) , prenatal BMI, percentage of family history of diabetes, incidence of macrosomia, concentration of low density lipoprotein were significantly higher in PGDM group than those in control group (all P<0.05). Women in PGDM group had significantly higher HbA1c concentration ((6.3�1.3)% vs (5.2�0.4)%) , fasting glucose [(6.3�2.3) vs (4.8�1.1) mmol/L], oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) -1 h glucose ((12.6�2.9) vs (7.1�1.3) mmol/L) and OGTT-2 h glucose [(12.0�3.0) vs (6.4�1.0) mmol/L] than those in control group (P<0.01). (3) The morbidity of preterm births was significantly higher (11.3% vs 1.0%, P<0.01), and the gestational age at delivery in PGDM group was significantly smaller [(37.6�2.3) vs (39.2�1.2) weeks, P<0.01]. Cesarean delivery rate in the PGDM group (70.8% vs 29.7%) was significantly higher than the control group (P<0.01). There was significantly difference between PGDM group and control in the neonatal male/female ratio (98/97 vs 111/84, P=0.033). The neonatal birth weight in PGDM group was significantly higher ((3 159�700) vs (3 451�423) g, P<0.01) . And the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia in the PGDM group was higher than the control group (7.7% vs 2.6%, P=0.036). (4) In the PGDM group, women who were treated with insulin had a smaller gestational age at delivery [(36.9�2.9) vs (37.9�2.5) weeks, P<0.01], and the neonates had a higher neonatal ICU (NICU) admission rate (24.2% vs 9.6%, P<0.01). Conclusions: The morbidity of PGDM in the 15 hospitals in Guangdong province is 0.472%. The majority of PGDM was diagnosed during pregnancy; HbA1c and fasting glucose are reliable parameters for PGDM screening. Women with PGDM have obvious family history of diabetes and repeated pregnancy may accelerate the process of diabetes mellitus. Women with PGDM have higher risk for preterm delivery and neonatal hypoglycemia. Unsatisfied glucose control followed by insulin treatment may increase the need for NICU admission.
Access barriers to effective medication treatment have been a persistent issue for millions of older Americans despite the establishment of Medicare Part D.
Self-rated health (SRH) may have different implications in various social and cultural settings. However, few studies are available concerning SRH among older persons across countries. The aim of this study was to analyse whether there are cross-national differences in the association between status characteristics, several diseases common among older persons, activities of daily living (ADL), and SRH. The study base was the Comparison of Longitudinal European Studies on Aging (CLESA), which includes data from six population-based studies on aging conducted in Finland, Israel, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. The study population comprised 5,629 persons, with participants from all countries except Italy. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between status characteristics, health conditions, ADL and SRH. To examine whether the association among status characteristics, health conditions, ADL and outcome differed across the CLESA countries, interaction terms defined as "variable*country" were considered separately for each variable. Regression analyses revealed that sex, education, lifetime occupation, heart disease and respiratory disease were differently distributed across countries. Among homogeneous factors, marital status (OR=1.21), hypertension (OR=1.41), stroke (OR=1.67), diabetes (OR=2.15), cancer (OR=1.47), musculoskeletal diseases (OR=2.44), and ADL (OR=2.72) turned out to be significantly associated with fair or poor SRH. The results indicate that there are differences in self-ratings of health across countries. These differences cannot be explained entirely by status characteristics, self-reported diseases or functional ability. However, an important finding was that in all countries most of the indicators of medical and functional health were homogeneously associated with SRH.
Bangladesh has a population with a low gastric cancer risk but high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Several studies have examined virulence genes in H. pylori from Bangladesh. We analyzed cagA and vacA subtypes and their association with severe histology phenotypes, and analyzed population types among Bangladeshi strains. We included patients who underwent endoscopy in Dhaka. Sequences of virulence genes and seven housekeeping genes were obtained by next generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We isolated 56 H. pylori strains from 133 patients, of which 73.2% carried cagA, and all were considered Western-type. Patients infected with cagA-positive strains had more severe histological scores than patients infected with cagA-negative strains. Among vacA s1 and m1 genotypes, the s1a (97.8%, 43/44) and m1c (28/30, 93.3%) genotypes were predominant. All strains containing s1 and m1 (30/56, 53.6%) also had i1, d1, and c1. In contrast, all strains containing the less-virulent genotypes s2 and m2 (12/56, 21.4%) also possessed i2, d2, and c2. Multivariate analysis indicated that subjects infected with vacA m1-genotype strains only had a significantly higher risk of antrum atrophy than patients infected with m2-genotype strains. Of the two main H. pylori populations in this study, hpAsia2 strains were associated with higher activity and inflammation in the antrum compared to hpEurope strains; however, only vacA s1m1i1d1c1 strains, independent of population type, were significantly associated with inflammation in the antrum, unlike the s2m2i2d2c2 genotype. In conclusion, Bangladeshi strains were divided into two main populations of different genotypes. The low incidence of gastric cancer in Bangladesh might be attributable to the high proportion of less-virulent genotypes, which may be a better predictor of gastric cancer risk than the ancestral origin of the H. pylori strains. Finally, the vacA m region may be a better virulence marker than other regions.
Macroscopic mechanical properties of human skin in vivo cannot be considered independent of adjacent subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). The layered system skin/sWAT appears as the hierarchical structural composite in which single layers behave as fiber-reinforced structures. Effective macroscopic mechanical properties of such composites are mainly determined either by the properties of the skin or by those of the sWAT, dependent on the conditions of mechanical loading. Mechanical interactions between the skin and the adjacent sWAT associated with a mismatch in the mechanical moduli of these two layers can lead to production of the skin wrinkles. Reinforcement of the composite skin/sWAT can take place in different ways. It can be provided through reorientation of collagen fibers under applied loading, through production of new bonds between existing collagen fibers and through induction of additional collagen structures. Effectiveness of this type of reinforcement is strongly dependent on the type of mechanical loading. Different physical interventions induce the reinforcement of at least one of these two layers, thus increasing the effective macroscopic stiffness of the total composite. At the same time, the standalone reinforcement of the skin appears to be less effective to achieve a delay or a reduction of the apparent signs of skin aging relative to the reinforcement of the sWAT.
A recent meta-analysis revealed that the genotype PNPLA3 rs738409 GG is associated with a higher risk of hepatic steatosis (HS) in Caucasian patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, controversial results were found regarding Asian populations. Furthermore, previous studies have shown a negative association between interferon lambda 3 (IFNL3) rs12979860 CC and HS in Caucasian CHC patients, but there have been no reports indicating any such association in Asian populations. In this study, then, we investigated the association of PNPLA3 and IFNL3 polymorphisms with HS in Asian CHC patients.
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a strong biomarker for liver fat accumulation and hepatic insulin sensitivity(1) . Previous studies have demonstrated that liver enzymes are predictors for incident diabetes(2) , but few of these studies were conducted in general Chinese population. One study, in an older urban cohort, did show such a relationship(3) .
We aimed to identify factors independently associated with greater benefit of a national reimbursement policy for blood glucose test strips in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), in terms of glycemic control and rate of severe hypoglycemia.
The association between hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and some diseases is becoming relevant in recent years. Providing appropriate management of HS from an early stage requires to include prompt diagnosis and treatment of concomitant diseases and to prevent any potential comorbidity. This approach should consider the adverse events of the drugs used to treat HS potentially related to the onset of a comorbidity.
Although soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2) in serum is known to be associated with ischemic heart disease and heart failure, data regarding its prognostic impact in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is limited. We evaluated the prognostic impacts of serum sST2 and other serum biomarkers in STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Serum uric acid levels increase in postmenopausal women, but decrease when hormone therapy (HT) is administered. No study has, however, evaluated the effects of different types of HT on serum uric acid levels. We therefore examined whether estrogen therapy (ET), estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT), and tibolone use affected serum uric acid levels in this population.
To evaluate whether quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine administered during the periconceptional period or during pregnancy was associated with increased risks for adverse obstetric events, adverse birth outcomes, or selected major structural birth defects.
To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes using two different testing strategies for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis: the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) and Carpenter-Coustan approaches. Specifically, we wanted to compare the rates of cesarean delivery between the two epochs.
The available evidence on the role of arsenic metabolism in individual susceptibility to the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes has not been formally and comprehensively reviewed.
This paper describes the implementation of an end-to-end remote monitoring platform based on the IEEE 11073 standards for Personal Health Devices (PHD). It provides an overview of the concepts and approaches and describes how the standard has been optimized for small devices with limited resources of processor, memory and power and that use short range wireless technology. It explains aspects of IEEE 11073, including the Domain Information Model, state model and nomenclature, and how these support its plug-and-play architecture. It shows how these aspects underpin a much larger eco-system of interoperable devices and systems that include IHE PCD-01, HL7 and BlueTooth LE medical devices, and the relationship to the Continua Guidelines, advocating the adoption of data standards and nomenclature to support semantic interoperability between health and ambient assisted living (AAL) in future platforms. The paper further describes the adaptions that have been made in order to implement the standard on the ZigBee Health Care Profile and the experiences of implementing an end-to-end platform that has been deployed to frail elderly patients with chronic disease(s) and patients with diabetes.
Chronic diseases constitute a major public health challenge. The prevalence of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) has increased. The objective of our study was to describe the prevalence, correlates, and time trends of MCC in the Israeli population and among the nation's 2 main population groups (Jewish and Arab).
Diabetes self-management education (DSME) is a fundamental element of type 2 diabetes care. Although 75% of adults with diabetes worldwide live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), limited DSME research has been conducted in LMICs. The objective of this study was to evaluate a home-based DSME intervention in rural Guatemala.
While migraine and obesity are related and associated with reduced executive functioning, no study has examined whether obesity exacerbates executive dysfunction in migraine. This cross-sectional study examined whether overweight/obesity moderated associations of migraine severity and associated features with inhibitory control, one aspect of executive function.
Natural teeth are still lost in adults despite improvements in dental care and access to treatment across the life span. The study examined whether tooth loss can be mitigated in adults experiencing diabetes. National online survey data from the Service Utilization among African Americans with Co-morbid Depression and Diabetes (n�=�275) were analyzed using logistic regression analyses. Diabetes was most prevalent among men (73.5%) and least prevalent among women (40.6%). In general and among the women, those without diabetes have approximately 50% fewer missing teeth than those with diabetes (odds ratio�=�.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.30, 0.83). Tooth loss is a traumatic experience and a serious life event that requires professional attention.
Growing public and private expenditure on healthcare results i.a. from the spreading of chronic diseases. Diabetes belongs to the most frequent ones, beyond neoplasms and cardiological diseases, and hence generates a significant burden for the public finance in terms of the direct costs, leading e.g. to the occurrence of opportunity cost of missed public investment. However, the economy suffers also from the indirect cost of diabetes that manifests itself in the loss in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and general government revenues.
This study was performed to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1D) and evaluate the cytokine-induced apoptotic reactions of beta-like insulin-producing cells differentiated from the iPSCs.
The joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data is an important tool of growing popularity to gain insights into the association between a biomarker and an event process. We develop a general framework of flexible additive joint models that allows the specification of a variety of effects, such as smooth nonlinear, time-varying and random effects, in the longitudinal and survival parts of the models. Our extensions are motivated by the investigation of the relationship between fluctuating disease-specific markers, in this case autoantibodies, and the progression to the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes. Using Bayesian P-splines, we are in particular able to capture highly nonlinear subject-specific marker trajectories as well as a time-varying association between the marker and event process allowing new insights into disease progression. The model is estimated within a Bayesian framework and implemented in the R-package bamlss.
Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a serious complication of diabetes. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S), a newly found gaseous signalling molecule, has an important role in many regulatory functions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of exogenous H2S on autophagy and its possible mechanism in DCM induced by type II diabetes (T2DCM). In this study, we found that sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) attenuated the augment in left ventricular (LV) mass and increased LV volume, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ameliorated H2S production in the hearts of db/db mice. NaHS facilitated autophagosome content degradation, reduced the expression of P62 (a known substrate of autophagy) and increased the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II. It also increased the expression of autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7) and Beclin1 in db/db mouse hearts. NaHS increased the expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1) and reduced the ubiquitylation level in the hearts of db/db mice. 1,4-Dithiothreitol, an inhibitor of disulphide bonds, increased the ubiquitylation level of Keap-1, suppressed the expression of Keap-1 and abolished the effects of NaHS on ubiquitin aggregate clearance and ROS production in H9C2 cells treated with high glucose and palmitate. Overall, we concluded that exogenous H2S promoted ubiquitin aggregate clearance via autophagy, which might exert its antioxidative effect in db/db mouse myocardia. Moreover, exogenous H2S increased Keap-1 expression by suppressing its ubiquitylation, which might have an important role in ubiquitin aggregate clearance via autophagy. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms responsible for the antioxidative effects of H2S in the context of T2DCM.
To the editor, We would like to thank Dr. Hurtado-Torres for his valuable comments on our article entitled "Chocolate Consumption and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke, and Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies", which was published in Nutrients in July 2017 [1]. [...].
To evaluate changes in peripapillary choroidal thickness (PCT) and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for diabetic retinopathy.
To assess health care utilization and vision outcomes over 2 years in patients receiving bevacizumab treatment in clinical practice for diabetic macular edema.

To investigate clinical characteristics of postcranioplasty seizures (PCS) first observed after cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy (DC) to treat traumatic brain injury and to define factors that increase PCS risk.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role of CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) and CD134/CD134 ligand (CD134L) in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) via the performance of a case-control study.The research objects were 234 cases of CHD patients and 120 cases of well-matched normal controls. Following the separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry were applied for the detection of mRNA levels and expression levels of CD40/CD40L and CD134/CD134L; meanwhile, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and Fas protein mRNA levels were detected using qRT-PCR.There was no statistical difference in the comparison of baseline characteristics between groups, indicating comparability between groups. qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that CD40/CD40L and CD134/CD134L mRNA and protein expression levels were all increased in the CHD group than those in the control group. Flow cytometry further confirmed the similar tendency. Meanwhile, ICAM-1 and Fas protein mRNA levels were elevated in the CHD group and positively correlated with the above parameters. Furthermore, CD40/CD40L expression rates were negatively correlated with gender and different types of CHD. Meanwhile, CD134/CD134L expressions were also higher in male patients, in patients with family history, previous history of hypertension, diabetes, and cerebrovascular diseases.CD40/CD40L and CD134/CD134L are increased and may have potential correlation with clinical pathological features of patients with CHD. Further in-depth exploration of costimulatory molecules for CHD guidance as well as intrinsic mechanisms are needed combined with in vivo and in vitro experiments.
Several studies reported that cancer is less frequent in persons with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases (AD/PD) and vice-versa. We evaluated whether a different distribution of known nongenetic risk factors for cancer and AD/PD, might explain their inverse relationship of occurrence. We nested 2 case-control studies in a subsample of a large cohort of 1,000,000 resident in Lombardy Region in Italy (n=1515), followed-up for cancer and AD/PD occurrence since 1991 until 2012. Conditional logistic regression was performed to determine the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of AD/PD in subjects with and without cancer and the risk of cancer in those with and without AD/PD. A total of 54 incident cases of AD/PD and 347 cancer cases were matched with 216 and 667 controls, respectively. After controlling for low education, obesity, history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, physical activity, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, and dietary habit, cancer was found inversely associated with the risk of AD/PD (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.32-1.38), and the risk of cancer in AD/PD was similarly reduced (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.91). Different exposures to nongenetic risk factors of both diseases do not explain their competitive relationship of occurrence.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains prevalent in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). As chronic infection with worse pulmonary outcomes develops frequently, the organism is concerning to CF providers and patients. This review describes current epidemiology, our understanding of risk factors for MRSA infection, and relevant aspects of treatment with review of new and ongoing trials.
Breath analyses have attracted substantial attention as screens for occupational environmental lung disease. The objective of this study was to develop breath tests for pneumoconiosis by analysing volatile organic compounds using an electronic nose. A case-control study was designed. We screened 102 subjects from a cohort of stone workers. After excluding three subjects with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and one subject with asthma, 98 subjects were enrolled, including 34 subjects with pneumoconiosis and 64 healthy controls. We analysed the subjects' breath using an electronic nose with 32 nanocomposite sensors. Data were randomly split into 80% for model building and 20% for validation. Using a linear discriminate analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were 67.9%, 88.0%, 80.8%, and 0.91, respectively, in the training set and 66.7%, 71.4%, 70.0%, and 0.86, respectively, in the test set. In subgroup analysis divided by smoking status, the AUROCs for current smokers, former smokers, and subjects who never smoked were 0.94, 0.93, and 0.99, respectively. In subgroup analysis divided by gender, the AUROCs for males and females were 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. Breath tests may have potential as a screen for pneumoconiosis. A multi-centre study is warranted, and the procedures must be standardized before clinical application.
Background Inequalities in access to medications among people diagnosed with diabetes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is a public health concern since untreated diabetes can lead to severe complications and premature death. Objective To assess evidence of inequalities in access to medication for diabetes in adult populations of people with diagnosed diabetes in LMICs. Design We conducted a systematic review of the literature using the PRISMA-Equity guidelines. A search of five databases - PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE - was conducted from inception to November 2015. Using deductive content analysis, information extracted from the selected articles was analysed according to the PRISMA-Equity guidelines, based on exposure variables (place of residence, race/ethnicity, occupation, gender, religion, education, socio-economic status, social capital, and others). Results Fifteen articles (seven quantitative and eight qualitative studies) are included in this review. There were inconsistent findings between studies conducted in different countries and regions although financial and geographic barriers generally contributed to inequalities in access to diabetes medications. The poor, those with relatively low education, and people living in remote areas had less access to diabetes medications. Furthermore, we found that the level of government political commitment through primary health care and in the provision of essential medicines was an important factor in promoting access to medications. Conclusions The review indicates that inequalities exist in accessing medication among diabetic populations, although this was not evident in all LMICs. Further research is needed to assess the social determinants of health and medication access for people with diabetes in LMICs.
Chronic instability in the health care environment has raised concerns among providers and patients, especially those who treat and cope with chronic conditions. Changes to existing health care laws are unlikely to alter what have become the primary goals of the US health care system: cost-effectiveness and patient-centricity. To that end, it is vital that patient and physician voices be incorporated in policy decisions and, importantly, that access to care and patient-reported outcomes are considered when calculating "value." Following a discussion of perceived pressures on patient access to information and appropriate treatment for diabetes, a panel of engaged stakeholders in the diabetes community outlined and committed to a collaborative effort aimed at effecting necessary policy changes and ensuring that a patient-centered, value-based system of diabetes care is achieved. The overarching themes that emerged included: (1) patients and physicians must have a stronger voice and a place at the table; (2) a collaborative of multiple organizations is necessary to seize improvement opportunities; and (3) the diabetes community must advocate for population health initiatives around diabetes.
The onset of acute and chronic illness in children frequently triggers episodes of stress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in mothers. Mothers of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) consistently report high levels of stress and PTSS. The purpose of this integrative review was to review and synthesize the published empirical research. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to conduct this integrative literature review. A total of 19 studies were identified from a sample of 128. Stress and PTSS were prevalent in mothers of youth with T1D. While PTSS was most severe at disease onset, symptoms often persisted 1 to 5 years after diagnosis. The diagnosis of T1D in a child was traumatic for mothers. Stress and PTSS in mothers adversely affected children's health. Management of stress symptoms in mothers may lead to improved behavioral and metabolic outcomes in children.
Postoperative delayed wound healing, surgical site infections (SSIs), and other wound complications are associated with increased morbidity and health-care costs. In cardiothoracic surgery, wound complications can have life-threatening consequences. In recent years, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been applied over closed surgical incisions to help reduce tension and protect from external contamination. We report our initial experiences using a closed incision negative pressure therapy (ciNPT) over clean, closed sternotomy incisions at an Irish tertiary referral centre.
Unhealed amputation stumps after transtibial amputation are common and often require reamputation futher up the leg. The aim of our study is to describe our experience with medial gastrocnemius muscle flap coverage following a transtibial amputation.
The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine differences and predictors of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with non-PCOS controls matched for body mass index.
Diet- and physical activity-based interventions in pregnancy have the potential to alter maternal and child outcomes.
The percutaneous transhepatic portal approach is the most commonly used technique for islet transplantation, largely owing to its safety and minimally invasive characteristic. Bleeding complications after islet transplantation are rare. A case of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) was treated in Tianjin First Center Hospital, who had a massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage after percutaneous transhepatic portal vein catheterization for islet transplantation. Through the review of the overall development of the case, we aim to improve the awareness of the complications of islet transplantation, to reduce the incidence of complications after percutaneous transhepatic portal vein transplantation, and to provide experience.
To evaluate the prognostic value of blood lactate (Lac) level in sepsis patients with or without diabetes.
Our goal in this investigation was to help shed light on the very difficult process of collaboration between family physicians and specialists working at different levels of healthcare delivery. More precisely, and grounded on Giddens' structuration theory, our investigation aims to understand how medical collaboration emerges and develops around chronic patients. This was a longitudinal interpretive case study, the "case" being a continuum-of-care for patients suffering from diabetes, put in place in an urban health center in the Canadian province of Quebec. The study shows how the application of rules of signification and of legitimation, combined with domination resources, have supported the emergence of new forms of collaborative practices. Our analysis reveals, however, that new collaborative practices at the administrative level do not necessarily entail greater shared decision-making in patient management and the mobilization of knowledge across boundaries. The study also corroborates the mutual recursive influence of practices and structures. Our study's most important contribution concerns the impact of knowledge dynamics, that is, individual and collective learning, on the development of medical collaboration across levels of care.
Identify costs, outcomes and stakeholders' perspectives associated with incorporation of community pharmacy services into the Thai National Health Insurance System and their values to all stakeholders.
Tricuspid valve replacement has been associated with high mortality and poor long-term outcomes. We report the preoperative risk factors associated with short and long-term outcomes following tricuspid valve replacement with mechanical prostheses.
Werner syndrome is a rare progeroid syndrome caused by the WRN gene mutation. It is characterized by a general appearance of premature aging, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis, and an increased risk of malignancies. We report a patient who presented with hematemesis due to cirrhosis of liver and was subsequently diagnosed with Werner syndrome. Further genetic analysis showed a novel mutation in the WRN gene which has not previously been reported. Werner syndrome should be considered for the cases of liver cirrhosis when accompanied by the features of accelerated aging.
Glucolipid metabolic disease (GLMD), a complex of interrelated disorders in glucose and lipid metabolism, has become one of the leading chronic diseases causing public and clinical problem worldwide. As the metabolism of lipid and glucose is a highly coordinated process under both physiological and diseased conditions, the impairment in the signals corresponding to the metabolism of either lipid or glucose represents the common mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of GLMD. The liver and adipose tissue are the major metabolic organs responsible for energy utilization and storage, respectively. This review article aims to summarize the current advances in the investigation of the functional roles and the underling mechanisms of the interplay between the liver and adipose tissue in the modulation of GLMD development. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and adiponectin represent the two major hormones secreted from the liver and adipose tissues, respectively. FGF21 exerts pleiotropic effects on regulating glucose and lipid homeostasis majorly through inducing the expression and secretion of adiponectin. Therefore, FGF21-adiponectin axis functions as the key mediator for the crosstalk between the liver and adipose tissue to exert the beneficial effects on the maintenance of the homeostasis of energy consumption. The liver- and adipose tissue-derived factors with pleiotropic effects on regulating of lipid and glucose metabolism function as the key mediator for the crosstalk between these two highly active metabolic organs, thereby coordinating the initiation and development of GLMD.
Hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver and many other metabolic disorder are frequently co-existing in patients. In addition, these diseases are closely related in pathophysiological settings. However, increasing of the disease incidence, lacking of comprehensive prevention and control measurements against the key pathology point concomitant occurrence with the pattern of the single disease, single target therapy, that is leading therapeutic strategy for these metabolic disorders in the setting of Western medicine (WM). On the basis of the combination of the advantages of integrated Chinese medicine (CM) and WM, with unified understanding of such diseases, the new concept of glucolipid metabolic disease (GLMD) is introduced. In this new concept, disorders in glucose and lipid metabolism are recognized as the key trigger and major driving force for the progress of GLMD. The key points of pathology included dysfunction of neuronal-endocrine-immune system, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation and intestinal flora imbalance. In the core pathogenic perspective of CM, it can be explained as "Gan (Liver) Shi Shu Xie" (dysfunction of Gan in metabolism and emotion regulation) that will lead to the occurence/production of endogenous dampness and phlegm, blood stasis and turbid. This leads to the new concept of "Liver-based regulatory system for metabolic homeostasis" to be introduced further. The comprehensive prevention and control strategy "Tiao Gan Qi Shu Hua Zhuo" (modulating Gan, trigging key metabolic system to resolve pathogenic factors such as phlegm retention and dampness). Its representative formula Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi Capsule () is innovated under such rationales. Comment for some commonly-used CM GLMD therapeutic drugs was presented. High-level evidence-based and epidemiological and mechanism studies should be carried out to further interpret and explain of the scientific connotation of GLMD.
Copeptin (pre-proAVP) secreted in equimolar amounts with vasopressin closely reflects vasopressin release. Copeptin has been shown to subtly mirror stress potentially mediated via corticotrophin-releasing hormone. To further test a potential direct interaction of corticotrophin-releasing hormone with copeptin release, which could augment vasopressin effects on pituitary function, we investigated copeptin response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone.
The "perfect" bariatric procedure remains the topic of debate. The aim of this study is to compare the safety and outcome of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) to those of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and adjustable gastric band (AGB) in a single centre, amongst those patients who made their own choice of which procedure they prefer.
The incidence of obesity with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing in Japan. The main bariatric surgery procedures in Japan are laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and LSG with duodenal-jejunal bypass (LSG/DJB) because of the high incidence of gastric cancer and difficulty exploring a remnant stomach after gastric bypass. However, few studies have compared the antidiabetic effect of LSG/DJB with LSG alone.
The field of the biology of ageing has received increasing attention from a biomedical point of view over the past decades. The main reason has been the realisation that increases in human population life expectancy are accompanied by late onset diseases. Indeed, ageing is the most important risk factor for a number of neoplastic, neurodegenerative and metabolic pathologies. Advances in the knowledge of the genetics of ageing, mainly through research in model organisms, have implicated various cellular processes and the respective signalling pathways that regulate them in cellular and organismal ageing. Associated with ageing is a dysregulation of metabolic homeostasis usually manifested as age-related obesity, diminished insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose and lipid homeostasis. Metabolic deterioration contributes to the ageing phenotype and metabolic pathologies are thought to be one of the main factors limiting the potential for lifespan extension. Great efforts have been directed towards identifying pharmacological interventions with the potential to improve healthspan and a number of natural and synthetic compounds have shown promise in achieving beneficial metabolic effects.
In this meta-analysis, evidence of an association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and low-energy fractures has been evaluated including 12 observational studies. The results suggested that T2DM patients had an enhanced risk of low-energy fractures.
Nonadherence to immunosuppressants is associated with rejection and allograft loss. Intrapatient variability (IPV) of immunosuppression levels is a marker of nonadherence. This study describes the impact of IPV of tacrolimus levels in patients receiving a tacrolimus monotherapy immunosuppression protocol.
The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled "Regulation of GLUT4 activity in myotubes by 3-O-methyl-D-glucose" (Shamni et al., 2017) [1]. These data show that the experimental procedures used to analyze the effects of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (MeGlc) on the rate of hexose transport into myotubes were valid and controlled. The stimulatory effect of MeGlc was limited to glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and was independent of ambient glucose and protein synthesis. Cornish-Bowden kinetic analysis of uptake data revealed that MeGlc attenuated indinavir-induced inhibition of hexose transport in a competitive manner.
Herein, we report the case of a 60-year-old man, a smoker with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. After computed tomography (CT) for an episode of hemoptysis, the patient underwent elective thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) because of a degenerative aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta. The area of perianeurysmal pulmonary atelectasis reported on the CT scan was not considered. Three months later, he developed an aortopulmonary fistula without endoleaks. Although TEVAR is a relatively safe procedure, no detail should be overlooked in the preoperative evaluation in order to avoid life-threatening complications. Further, the effectiveness and modality of prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis and/or preoperative respiratory physiotherapy should be assessed in such cases.
Conventionally, the juice and extract of Alangium salvifolium leaves have been used for the treatment of diabetes, wound healing, dog bite, and as a poultice in rheumatism. To carry out the sub-chronic toxicity and thereafter safety evaluation of A. salvifolium leaves. The aqueous extract of A. salvifolium leaves was administered orally at the doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day for 90 days. All the animals were observed daily for general behavior, changes in body weight, food, and water consumption. At the end of the treatment period, biochemical and hematological parameters were analyzed; and the animals were sacrificed for histopathological examination of heart, lungs, liver, and kidney. The general behavior and water intake were normal in all the rats. The increase in body weight was observed in female rats of all the groups while body weight was decreased in high dose group animals of both sexes. Hematological parameters were not disturbed by the continuous use of extract. A significant decrease in glucose level was observed in intermediate- and high-dose group animals while urea and creatinine level were significantly high in animals of high-dose group. Although histopathological examination of most of the organs exhibited no structural changes, some tubal damage in kidneys was observed in high-dose group animals. The high dose of extract has shown mild signs of toxicity on kidney function test, but no toxic response was observed on hematological and liver biochemical parameters. The extract also exhibited hypoglycemic potential.
Regular physical activity is an important component in the management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), as it has the potential to improve glycemic control, delay cardiovascular complications, and increase overall well-being. Unfortunately, many children and adolescents with diabetes do not partake in regular exercise and physical activity for multiple reasons. This review identifies the barriers to participation from the aspect of the patient, caregiver, and the healthcare provider. The management of physical activity of children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus is unique and requires an understanding of exercise physiology and how it differs in these children and adolescents from those without the condition. These individuals are at risk for important and potentially life threatening complications including, but not limited to, severe or delayed nocturnal hypoglycemia. It is essential to identify these risks as well as, monitor and manage adjustments to carbohydrate intake and insulin dosing through basal-bolus regimen or insulin pump adjustments appropriately before, during, and after the exercise activity. This review discusses these issues and also outlines differences in management between patients with T1DM and T2DM.
Fungal and bacterial infections are often which may cause sepsis. Mucormycosis is an unfrequent, but often life-threatening disease. A timely diagnosis and treatment is the cornerstone of success. An increase in incidence can be expected, given an aging population and increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes and cancer. We present a rare case where early diagnosis has helped to treat the patient mainly with antifungal therapy as surgical therapy has had high risk of complications.
Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) represents a clustering of different metabolic abnormalities. MetSyn prevalence is present in approximately 25% of all adults with increased prevalence in advanced ages. The presence of one component of MetSyn increases the risk of developing MetSyn later in life and likely represents a high lifetime burden of cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore we pooled data from multiple studies to establish the prevalence of MetSyn and MetSyn component prevalence across a broad range of ethnicities. PubMed, SCOPUS and Medline databases were searched to find papers presenting MetSyn and MetSyn component data for 18-30�year olds who were apparently healthy, free of disease, and MetSyn was assessed using either the harmonized, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII), American Heart Association/National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute (AHA/NHBLI), or International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definitions of MetSyn. After reviewing returned articles, 26,609 participants' data from 34 studies were included in the analysis and the data were pooled. MetSyn was present in 4.8-7% of young adults. Atherogenic dyslipidaemia defined as low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was the most prevalent MetSyn component (26.9-41.2%), followed by elevated blood pressure (16.6-26.6%), abdominal obesity (6.8-23.6%), atherogenic dyslipidaemia defined as raised triglycerides (8.6-15.6%), and raised fasting glucose (2.8-15.4%). These findings highlight that MetSyn is prevalent in young adults. Establishing the reason why low HDL is the most prevalent component may represent an important step in promoting primary prevention of MetSyn and reducing the incidence of subsequent clinical disease.
Drugs that allosterically modulate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity display higher specificity and may improve disease treatment. However, the rational design of compounds that target the allosteric site is difficult, as conformations required for receptor activation are poorly understood. Guided by photopharmacology, a set of prearranged positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) with restricted degrees of freedom was designed and tested against the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a GPCR involved in glucose homeostasis. Compounds incorporating a trans-stilbene comprehensively outperformed those with a cis-stilbene, as well as the benchmark BETP, as GLP-1R PAMs. We also identified major effects of ligand conformation on GLP-1R binding kinetics and signal bias. Thus, we describe a photopharmacology-directed approach for rational drug design, and introduce a new class of stilbene-containing PAM for the specific regulation of GPCR activity.
The Korean Registry of Target Organ Damage in Hypertension aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics and prevalence of subclinical target organ damage in Korean hypertensive patients.
We studied JAZF1, ABCC8, KCNJ11and Notch2 gene expression and vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms (Fok1 and Bsm1) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and tried to find out their association with microvascular complications in these patients.
It is estimated that 29.1 million people or 9.3% of the US population have diabetes, which contributes to considerable medical and financial burden. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and insulin secretion impairment leading to hyperglycemia. The presence of insulin resistance is strongly correlated with obesity.
Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with pharmacotherapy should be adherent to and persistent with their medications to experience glycemic control and prevent associated complications.
Diabetes related distress is common in type 1 diabetes patients (T1D). High levels of diabetes distress are related to poor metabolic control. An instrument to evaluate diabetes distress in T1D patients is "type 1 diabetes scale-T1DDS". The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the T1DDS into Brazilian culture.
Diet and exercise therapy have been reported to be effective in improving blood glucose control and are an important part of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methylation plays an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to identify aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways in CRC by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.
Adverse events (AEs) related to medical treatments in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are frequent and need an appropriate costing in health economic models. Nevertheless, data on costs associated with AEs in NSCLC are scarce, particularly since the development of immunotherapy with specific immune-related AEs.
Our studies over recent years have focused on some new ideas concerning the pathogenesis for the orbital reaction that characterizes Graves' ophthalmopathy namely, that there are antigens expressed by thyroid tissue and orbital tissue where they are targeted by autoantibodies and/or sensitized T cells, leading to orbital inflammation. While this has been well studied for the thyroid stimulating hormone-receptor, the possible role of another major thyroid antigen, Thyroglobulin (TG), has been largely ignored.
To investigate the hypothesis that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) increases the risk of new onset diabetes mellitus (DM) or significant changes in fasting blood sugar (FBS).
The aim of this study is to evaluate the causes of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in postmenopausal female patients (PMFP) and correlate their symptoms with their urodynamic study (UDS) findings.
Tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) are assessed as immunomodulatory adjuvants to regulate autoimmunity. The underlying gene expression endorsing their regulatory features remains ill-defined. Using deep mRNA sequencing, we compared transcriptomes of 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3/dexametasone-modulated tolDCs with that of non-modulated mature inflammatory DCs (mDCs). Differentially expressed genes controlled cellular interactions, metabolic pathways and endorse tolDCs with the capacity to regulate cell activation through nutrient and signal deprivation, collectively gearing tolDCs into tolerogenic immune regulators. Gene expression differences correlated with protein expression, designating low CD86 and high CD52 on the cell surface as superior discriminators between tolDCs and mDCs. Of 37 candidate genes conferring risk to developing type 1 diabetes (T1D), 11 genes differentially expressed in tolDCs and mDCs regulated immune response and antigen-presenting activity. Differential-expressed transcripts of candidate risk loci for T1D suggest a role of these 'risk genes' in immune regulation, which targeting may modulate the genetic contribution to autoimmunity.Genes and Immunity advance online publication, 10 August 2017; doi:10.1038/gene.2017.18.
During obesity, macrophages can infiltrate metabolic tissues, and contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation, and mediate insulin resistance and diabetes. Recent studies have elucidated the metabolic role of JAK2, a key mediator downstream of various cytokines and growth factors. Our study addresses the essential role of macrophage JAK2 in the pathogenesis to obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance. During high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, macrophage-specific JAK2 knockout (M-JAK2(-/-)) mice gained less body weight compared to wildtype littermate control (M-JAK2(+/+)) mice and were protected from HFD-induced systemic insulin resistance. Histological analysis revealed smaller adipocytes and qPCR analysis showed upregulated expression of some adipogenesis markers in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of HFD-fed M-JAK2(-/-) mice. There were decreased crown-like structures in VAT along with reduced mRNA expression of some macrophage markers and chemokines in liver and VAT of HFD-fed M-JAK2(-/-) mice. Peritoneal macrophages from M-JAK2(-/-) mice and Jak2 knockdown in macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 also showed lower levels of chemokine expression and reduced phosphorylated STAT3. However, leptin-dependent effects on augmenting chemokine expression in RAW 264.7 cells did not require JAK2. Collectively, our findings show that macrophage JAK2 deficiency improves systemic insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation in VAT and liver in response to metabolic stress.
Obesity is a serious medical condition highly associated with health problems such as diabetes, hypertension, and stroke. Obesity is highly associated with negative emotional states, but the relationship between obesity and emotional states in terms of neuroimaging has not been fully explored. We obtained 196 emotion task functional magnetic resonance imaging (t-fMRI) from the Human Connectome Project database using a sampling scheme similar to a bootstrapping approach. Brain regions were specified by automated anatomical labeling atlas and the brain activity (z-statistics) of each brain region was correlated with body mass index (BMI) values. Regions with significant correlation were identified and the brain activity of the identified regions was correlated with emotion-related clinical scores. Hippocampus, amygdala, and inferior temporal gyrus consistently showed significant correlation between brain activity and BMI and only the brain activity in amygdala consistently showed significant negative correlation with fear-affect score. The brain activity in amygdala derived from t-fMRI might be good neuroimaging biomarker for explaining the relationship between obesity and a negative emotional state.
Diabetes-associated male sexual dysfunction and fertility impairments are both common clinical complications with limited therapeutic options; hence it seriously affects the quality of life of the patients, in particular, the patients of reproductive age. Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) has long being believed to maintain and to promote reproductive functions in the traditional medical practice in China. The current study was to investigate if LBP may contribute to recovery of male sexual dysfunction and fertility impairments in diabetic individuals. The effects of LBP on sexual behaviors and histological changes of testis were studied in the type-1 diabetes male mice induced by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ). After oral administration of LBP (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg), sildenafil citrate (SC, 5 mg/kg) or saline for 62 consecutive days, the typical abnormal changes in the sperm parameters, in relative weight of reproductive organs and in morphology of testis were observed in diabetic mice. LBP treatment of the diabetic mice considerably reversed those changes and Johnsen's testicular score, serum testosterone (T), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) level were also increased to different degrees. Moreover, our data have also shown that a marked improvement in sexual behavior and fertility level after administration of LBP (40 mg/kg) compared to the diabetic group. These results suggested that LBP can exert functional recovery of male sexual dysfunction and fertility damages induced by diabetes in male mice, which is likely to be mediated through regulating the hypothalamus- pituitary-gonadal axis endocrine activity.
Oman is located in the southeast of Arabian Peninsula with a relatively young population of about 3 831 553 people. The Ministry of Health, which is the healthcare provider, is facing a challenge with the increased levels of noncommunicable diseases including chronic kidney disease. A growing number of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), demanding renal replacement therapy. In 2014, there were 1339 of ESKD patients receiving dialysis and almost 1400 patients received kidney transplants. The estimated annual incidence of ESKD is 120 patients per million population. Diabetes mellitus and hypertensive nephropathy are the commonly identified causes of ESKD. Many patients with glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nephrolithiasis, and inherited kidney disease present with advanced chronic kidney disease. This article reviews the current status of kidney disease in Oman and addresses the present and future needs, through a systematic-review of all related papers.
While ovulation is most likely to occur in adolescent girls with regular menstrual cycles, there are limited data on the incidence of ovulation in girls with irregular menstrual cycles in early postmenarcheal years. The aim of the study was to evaluate the presence of ovulation in healthy postmenarcheal girls with irregular menstrual cycles.
To determine whether the effects of intensive (<120 mmHg) compared with standard (<140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment are different among those with prediabetes versus those with fasting normoglycemia at baseline in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).
Periodontal disease (PD) in diabetic patients is described as the 6th complication of diabetes. We have previously shown that diabetes increases dental caries, and carious inflammation might have a strong effect on the adjacent periodontal tissue in diabetic rodent models. However, the possibility that hyperglycemia may induce PD in diabetic animals could not be completely eliminated. The goal of this study was to confirm the presence of PD in diabetic animal models by preventing carious inflammation with fluoride administration. F344 rats injected with alloxan (type-1 diabetic model) and db/db mice (type-2 diabetic model) were given either tap water alone or tap water containing fluoride. A cariostatic effect of fluoride was evident in the diabetic animals. Meanwhile, fluoride treatment drastically attenuated periodontal inflammation in addition to preventing dental caries. Furthermore, with fluoride treatment, periodontitis was notably nonexistent in the periodontal tissue surrounding the normal molars, whereas the caries-forming process was clearly observed in the teeth that were enveloped with persistent periodontitis, suggesting that enhanced periodontal inflammation might have been derived from the dental caries in the diabetic rodents rather than from the PD. In conclusion, long-term hyperglycemia naturally induces dental caries but not PD in type-1 and type-2 diabetic rodents.
A third of the patients with Type 2 diabetes have an advance disease that requires complex pharmacotherapies and advanced expertise, dependent on multiple clinical interactions. Unfortunately, limited providers availability enables only sporadic interactions. Additionally, the expanding Accountable Care Organization (ACO) concept enhances providers' compensation when clinical performance is improving while limiting face-to-face clinic visits.
Statins are a class of therapeutics used to regulate serum cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. Although statins are highly effective in removing cholesterol from the blood, their consumption has been linked to potential adverse effects in some individuals. The most common events associated with statin intolerance are myopathy and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the pathological mechanism through which statins cause these adverse effects is not well understood.
The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus is approved as an antitumor agent in advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Surrogate bone marker data from clinical trials suggest effects on bone metabolism, but the mode of action of everolimus in bone biology remains unclear. In this study, we assessed potential bone-protective effects of everolimus in the context of osteotropic tumors.
The global pandemic of obesity has led to an increased risk for prediabetes and type-2 diabetes (T2D). The aims of the current project are: (1) to evaluate the effect of a 22-week family based intervention program, including supervised exercise, on insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) risk in children with a high risk of developing T2D and (2) to identify the profile of microRNA in circulating exosomes and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in children with a high risk of developing T2D and its response to a multidisciplinary intervention program including exercise.
[6]-Gingerol, a major component of Zingiber officinale, was previously reported to ameliorate hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic mice. Endocrine signaling is involved in insulin secretion and is perturbed in db/db Type-2 diabetic mice. [6]-Gingerol was reported to restore the disrupted endocrine signaling in rodents. In this current study on Lepr(db/db) diabetic mice, we investigated the involvement of endocrine pathway in the insulin secretagogue activity of [6]-Gingerol and the mechanism(s) through which [6]-Gingerol ameliorates hyperglycemia.
Failure to attain peak lung function by early adulthood is a risk factor for chronic lung diseases. Previously, we reported that C3H/HeJ mice have about twice total lung capacity (TLC) compared to JF1/MsJ mice. We identified seven lung function quantitative trait loci (QTL: Lfnq1-Lfnq7) in backcross/intercross mice derived from these inbred strains. We further demonstrated, superoxide dismutase 3, extracellular (Sod3), Kit oncogene (Kit) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1) located on these Lfnqs as lung function determinants. Emanating from the concept of early origin of lung disease, we sought to identify novel candidate genes for pulmonary function by investigating lung transcriptome in C3H/HeJ and JF1/MsJ mice at the completion of embryonic development, bulk alveolar formation and maturity.
Inequitable access to healthy food may contribute to health disparities. This study examines the relationship between the prevalence of adult diabetes and food access in the U.S. by county economic/racial composition.
To assess factors associated with the preferred role of the attending ophthalmologist in the decision-making processes before treating diabetic retinopathy (DR).
The elderly are predisposed to septic arthritis (SA) because of the aging nature and increasing comorbidities. SA may in turn increase the long-term mortality in the geriatric patients; however, it remains unclear. We conducted this prospective nationwide population-based cohort study to clarify this issue.
A single bout of exercise induces changes in gene expression in skeletal muscle. Regular exercise results in an adaptive response involving changes in muscle architecture and biochemistry, and is an effective way to manage and prevent common human diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disorders and type II diabetes. However, the biomolecular mechanisms underlying such responses still need to be fully elucidated. Here we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of skeletal muscle tissue in a large cohort of untrained Thoroughbred horses (n�=�51) before and after a bout of high-intensity exercise and again after an extended period of training. We hypothesized that regular high-intensity exercise training primes the transcriptome for the demands of high-intensity exercise.
Glycation and oxidation induce structural alterations in the proteins in an inter-dependent manner with consequent pathological implications. The published literature presents wide range of modifications in conformational characteristics of proteins by glycation and oxidation; however, there is little data that could elaborate the cumulative effect of both the processes. This study has analysed the modifications in IgG by methylglyoxal (MG) (glycative stress), hydroxyl radical (OH(�)) (oxidative stress) and by their combined action i.e. OH(�) treatment of MG glycated IgG (glycoxidation). It further addresses the implications of the altered structural integrity of IgG on its immunological characteristics and impact on haematological parameters in rabbits. Using circular dichroism, FTIR, SDS-PAGE analysis, thioflavin-T fluorescence assay, congo red absorbance analysis, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, ELISA, blood cell counts and rectal temperature studies, we report that the glycoxidative modification caused maximum alteration in the IgG as compared to the glycatively and oxidatively modified protein. Far-UV CD results confirmed the highest decline in the beta pleated sheet content of the protein by glycoxidation. The damage led to the reduced flexibility and enhanced electronic interactions in IgG as observed by near-UV CD. Modifications caused cross linking and adduct formation in the serum protein. The electron micrograph confirmed amorphous aggregation in modified IgG. The modifications increased the hydrodynamic radius of IgG by allowing the attachment of OH� and MG residues. The glycoxidatively modified IgG induced the maximum antibody titres that showed high specificity towards the altered IgG. The glycoxidation of IgG leads to activation of inflammatory pathways.
Purpose The African American church has long been recognized as a valuable partner for health interventions in the community. While an extensive literature exists documenting the potential efficacy of diabetes education programs in church settings, there has yet to be an effort to leverage spiritual beliefs and practices to promote diabetes self-management and shared decision making within a faith-based framework that is culturally tailored to the African American church. The purpose of this article is to describe the translation of a clinic-based diabetes education program into faith-based education curriculum tailored for use in the African American church. Conclusions Themes extracted from focus groups and input from a faith-based community partner provided a methodical and patient-informed foundation for culturally tailoring and piloting a diabetes self-management curriculum for the African American church setting. This study illustrates how spirituality can be incorporated into interventions to enhance health promotion and behavioral change among African Americans with diabetes. Participants in our study described how religious beliefs play an active role in many aspects of diabetes care, including self-management behaviors, coping strategies, and patient/provider communication. In addition, this intervention can serve as a model for the development of patient-centered health interventions.
Our previous research obtained Litchi chinensis Sonn. seeds extract (LSE) which showed hypoglycaemic effects on type 2 diabetes (T2D) rats. In order to understand the detailed pathogenesis of diabetes intervened by LSE, the metabonomics strategy was used. As a result, LSE decreased insulin resistance index and the levels of glucose in urine through elevating the mRNA level of insulin, while decreasing the expression of glucagon to enhance the function of pancreas. Meanwhile, LSE regulated the glucose and fatty acid metabolisms via increasing the expression of glucose transporter (Glu) 2, Glu4, insulin receptor (IR) and IR substrate-2 (IRS2). LSE effectively restored the impairment of the IRS2/ PI3K/ Akt/ mTOR insulin signaling in the livers. All in all, LSE played a pivotal role in the treatment of T2D through regulation of broad-spectrum metabolic changes and inhibition of the glycogenesis, proteolysis and lipogenesis in T2D rats.
To investigate the screening rate for gastric, breast, and cervical cancer in people with diabetes compared with people without diabetes.
Timely and important studies are reviewed and commentaries provided by leading palliative care clinicians. Symptoms, interventions, mechanisms of action, and treatment-related adverse events addressed in this issue are: acupuncture for neck pain, role of IL-10 in neuropathic pain, treatments for diabetic neuropathy, probiotics for antibiotic-related diarrhea, and risk of fatal drug poisoning with opioid analgesics.
One hundred patients of Diabetes Mellitus (70 with and 30 without clinical somatic neuropathy) were studied to correlate clinical severity with the magnitude of nerve conduction abnormalities. Age range was 10-79 years (mean 49) with equal number of males and females. Incidence of neuropathy was more in patients over 40 years of age (60 out of 70 patients) with duration of disease over two years (78.33%). The grades of severity were mild in 22 (31.33%), moderate in 25 (35.71%) and severe in 23 (32.86%) patients. Nerve conduction studies were carried out in 48 (27 with and 21 without clinical neuropathy) patients, using the apparatus Dantec (Cantata TM). The nerves (median, peroneal and sural) were stimulated at two points and the recording of latency; amplitude (micro V) and motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (m/s) were done under identical environmental conditions. Sensory nerve conduction velocity was more affected than motor velocity. In the 21 patients without clinical neuropathy, 14 showed abnormalities indicating early involvement of peripheral nerves. Reduction of motor nerve conduction velocity was more in patients with moderate and severe grades. The reduction was more in lower than in upper limbs. Nerve conduction abnormality helps in diagnosis in diabetic neuropathy even in preclinical state and correlates with severity, in clinical neuropathy.
204 healthy family members of 91 known diabetics were screened for abnormal carbohydrate tolerance (ACT). The prevalence of asymptomatic diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance were found to be 3.44% and 8.33% respectively. There was positive correlation in the prevalence of ACT and age of the family members. Male children of diabetic parents were at higher risk of inheriting the disease. The risk increased when compounded with obesity and mumps infection. Suitable preventive strategies have been highlighted.
In association with increasing diabetes prevalence, it is desirable to develop new glucose sensing systems with low cost, ease of use, high stability and good portability. Boronic acid is one of the potential candidates for a future alternative to enzyme-based glucose sensors. Boronic acid derivatives have been widely used for the sugar recognition motif, because boronic acids bind adjacent diols to form cyclic boronate esters. In order to develop colorimetric sugar sensors, boronic acid-conjugated azobenzenes have been synthesized. There are several types of boronic acid azobenzenes, and their characteristics tend to rely on the substitute position of the boronic acid moiety. For example, o-substitution of boronic acid to the azo group gives the advantage of a significant color change upon sugar addition. Nitrogen-15 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies clearly show a signaling mechanism based on the formation and cleavage of the B-N dative bond between boronic acid and azo moieties in the dye. Some boronic acid-substituted azobenzenes were attached to a polymer or utilized for supramolecular chemistry to produce glucose-selective binding, in which two boronic acid moieties cooperatively bind one glucose molecule. In addition, boronic acid-substituted azobenzenes have been applied not only for glucose monitoring, but also for the sensing of glycated hemoglobin and dopamine.
This article reviews recent progress made in the development of electrochemical glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) sensors for the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. Electrochemical HbA1c sensors are divided into two categories based on the detection protocol of the sensors. The first type of sensor directly detects HbA1c by binding HbA1c on the surface of an electrode through bio-affinity of antibody and boronic acids, followed by an appropriate mode of signal transduction. In the second type of sensor, HbA1c is indirectly determined by detecting a digestion product of HbA1c, fructosyl valine (FV). Thus, the former sensors rely on the selective binding of HbA1c to the surface of the electrodes followed by electrochemical signaling in amperometric, voltammetric, impedometric, or potentiometric mode. Redox active markers, such as ferrocene derivatives and ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ions, are often used for electrochemical signaling. For the latter sensors, HbA1c must be digested in advance by proteolytic enzymes to produce the FV fragment. FV is electrochemically detected through catalytic oxidation by fructosyl amine oxidase or by selective binding to imprinted polymers. The performance characteristics of HbA1c sensors are discussed in relation to their use in the diagnosis and control of diabetic mellitus.

The aim of this paper was to systematically review published randomized controlled trials of peer education interventions among adults with type 2 diabetes.
Osteoporotic vertebral fractures adversely impact quality of life and also increase the risk of infection and mortality. Alendronate treatment increases bone mass and reduces the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis by suppressing bone resorption. We investigated the relationship between alendronate treatment and infection-related death in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures.
Huangqi Decoction (HQD) has been traditionally used to treat diabetes mellitus in China. The present study was carried out to assess the protective effect of HQD on diabetic nephropathy (DN) using the streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetic rats.
Blood flow regulation in pancreatic islets is critical for function but poorly understood. Here, we establish an in�vivo imaging platform in a non-human primate where islets transplanted autologously into the anterior chamber of the eye are monitored non-invasively and longitudinally at single-cell resolution. Engrafted islets were vascularized and innervated and maintained the cytoarchitecture of in�situ islets in the pancreas. Blood flow velocity in the engrafted islets was not affected by increasing blood glucose levels and/or the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide. However, islet blood flow was dynamic in nature and fluctuated in various capillaries. This was associated with vasoconstriction events resembling a sphincter-like action, most likely regulated by adrenergic signaling. These observations suggest a mechanism in primate islets that diverts blood flow to cell regions with higher metabolic demand. The described imaging technology applied in non-human primate islets may contribute to a better understanding of human islet pathophysiology.

the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of telephone-based support for the metabolic control of elderly patients with diabetes mellitus.
Since the enforcement of Generics Act (1999), three types of pharmaceutically equivalent products are marketed in Brazil: innovative reference (REF), "similar" (S) and generic (G) drugs. The S (brand name) and G (generic name) borrow from REF (brand name) clinical data on safety and efficacy and dosage regimen. G (but not S) is bioequivalent to and interchangeable with REF. Starting in 2003, Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) has required data on relative bioavailability tests (with REF) to approve (or renew registration of) S drugs. In 2014, Anvisa extended interchangeability notion to similar drugs with a "comparable" bioavailability, i.e., an "equivalent" similar drug (EQ). Drugs for chronic diseases and "critical dose medicines" are listed among the EQ drugs approved. Interchangeability of nonbioequivalent medicines raises deep concerns regarding therapeutic failures and adverse events. Concerns are even more worrisome if patients switch from one drug to another during an ongoing treatment for illnesses such as epilepsy, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes and/or substitutable drugs have a narrow therapeutic index.
To evaluate the pulmonary oxidative stress in diabetic rats exposed to hyperoxia for 90 minutes.
The specific phenotype of mature differentiated beta cells not only depends on the specific presence of genes that allow beta cell function but also on the selective absence of housekeeping genes ("disallowed genes") that would interfere with this function. Recent studies have shown that both histone modifications and DNA methylation via the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A are involved in repression of disallowed genes in neonatal beta cells when these cells acquire their mature phenotype. It is unknown, however, if the environmental influence of advanced age, pregnancy and the metabolic stress of high fat diet or diabetes could alter the repression of disallowed genes in beta cells. In the present study, we show that islet disallowed genes-which are also deeply repressed in FACS-purified beta cells-remain deeply repressed in animals of advanced age and in pregnant females. Moreover, the stability of this repression was correlated with strong and stable histone repression marks that persisted in islets isolated from 2 year old mice and with overall high expression of Dnmt3a in islets. Furthermore, repression of disallowed genes was unaffected by the metabolic stress of high fat diet. However, repression of about half of the disallowed genes was weakened in 16 week-old diabetic db/db mice. In conclusion, we show that the disallowed status of islet genes is stable under physiological challenging conditions (advanced age, pregnancy, high fat diet) but partially lost in islets from diabetic animals.
Data on the growth of diabetic children is conflicting. The aim of this study was to create and validate acceptable body mass index (BMI)-standardized percentiles and curves applied to Egyptian prepubescent diabetic children.
Administration of parenteral nutrition (PN) may result in hyperglycemia in patients with preexisting diabetes or disease-related insulin resistance, and it can be associated with increased rates of complications. Treatment requires insulin therapy. Insulin can be administered subcutaneously, intravenously via a variable rate sliding scale, or by adding it directly to the PN. The last method is a potentially attractive technique for a number of reasons-it could deliver the insulin intravenously at a steady rate alongside carbohydrates, and in malnourished patients with little subcutaneous tissue, it may prevent the need for frequent insulin injections. Despite such potential advantages, the addition of insulin to PN remains controversial, largely with respect to the bioavailability of insulin in PN and resultant concerns of the risk of hypoglycemia. There is a paucity of long-term quality controlled studies to address this question. The available literature suggests that, at least in the short term, insulin addition to PN can achieve reasonable glycemic control with low rates of hypoglycemia, and the technique compares favorably with the use of long-acting insulin preparations. This literature review finds a wide range of values reported for insulin availability via PN, ranging from 44% to 95% depending on the type of PN container material used and the presence of added vitamins and trace elements. Few studies looking at glycemic control among patients receiving home PN were found, and larger prospective trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of this technique in this patient group.
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer were responsible for 68% of all deaths worldwide in 2012. The regional distribution of lipid deposited within adipose tissue (AT) - so called body fat distribution (BFD) - is a strong risk factor for NCDs. BFD is highly heritable; however, the genetic basis of BFD is almost entirely unknown. Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with BFD, including at Plexin D1 (PLXND1) - a gene known to modulate angiogenesis. We recently demonstrated that zebrafish homozygous for a null mutation in plxnd1 had a reduced capacity to store lipid in visceral AT (VAT) leading to altered BFD. Moreover, we found that type V collagens were upregulated in plxnd1 mutants, and mediated the inhibitory effect of Plxnd1 on VAT growth. These results strengthen evidence that Plxnd1 influences BFD in human populations, and validate zebrafish as a model to study BFD. However, many pertinent questions remain unanswered. Here we outline potential Plxnd1 mechanisms of action in AT, and describe the genetic architecture at human PLXND1 that is associated with BFD and NCD susceptibility.
Over the past 2�decades, the incidence of childhood obesity has risen dramatically. This recent rise in childhood obesity is particularly concerning as adults who were obese during childhood develop type II diabetes that is intractable to current forms of treatment compared with individuals who develop obesity in adulthood. While the mechanisms responsible for the exacerbated diabetic phenotype associated with childhood obesity is not clear, it is well known that childhood is an important time period for the establishment of normal white adipose tissue in humans. This association suggests that exposure to obesogenic stimuli during adipose development may have detrimental effects on adipose function and metabolic homeostasis. In this study, we identify the period of development associated with puberty, postnatal days 18-34, as critical for the establishment of normal adipose mass in mice. Exposure of mice to high fat diet only during this time period results in metabolic dysfunction, increased leptin expression, and increased adipocyte size in adulthood in the absence of sustained increased fat mass or body weight. These findings indicate that exposure to obesogenic stimuli during critical developmental periods have prolonged effects on adipose tissue function that may contribute to the exacerbated metabolic dysfunctions associated with childhood obesity.
Stevia rebaudiana (SR) is often used by the food industry due to its steviol glycoside content, which is a suitable calorie-free sweetener. Further, both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that these glycosides and the extracts from SR have pharmacological and therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and anticancer. This work reviews the antiobesity, antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic effects of the majority of glycosides and aqueous/alcoholic extracts from the leaves, flowers, and roots of the SR. These compounds can serve as a natural and alternative treatment for diseases that are associated with metabolic syndrome, thus contributing to health promotion.
The adverse effects of exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke on glucose and lipid parameters in women and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this prospective community-based study, we examined the effects of passive smoking on glycemic parameters and lipid profiles in a Chinese female population.
Glycated albumin (GA) reflects serum glucose of the preceding 2 - 3 weeks and plays an important role in diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed at investigating whether GA can assess renal dysfunction in population.
Currently, it is not well understood how the contribution of basal versus postprandial plasma glucose changes in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with different treatment regimens. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting as well as postprandial blood glucose and to determine how these relationships changed during DM progression in Chinese diabetic patients with different treatment regimens.
To delineate the metabolomic profiling and identify early diagnostic biomarkers in maternal plasma from the pregnant women who subsequently developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF MS).
Malondialdehyde low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) is a major form of oxidized LDL and considered to be more atherogenic than LDL. Information on major determinants of MDA-LDL and their association in subjects who are not under treatment for diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia is limited.
The diaTribe Foundation convened a meeting on the topic of discuss glycemic outcomes beyond A1C on July 21, 2017, in Bethesda, MD, focusing on potential uses of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Understanding patterns of glycemia in persons with diabetes has long been a focus of approaches to improving treatment ((2) ), and over the past few years this has become an available modality for clinical practice ((3) ). Glucose levels are not the only biologic parameters affecting A1c levels.
Intestinal failure-associated liver disease is rare in adults and risk factors are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors of liver fibrosis in adults receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for intestinal failure and its impact on survival.

Aerobic exercise training has consistently been shown to be an effective therapy in the management of Type 2 diabetes, resulting in reductions in HbA1c of ~8 mmol/mol (0.7%) [1]. Moreover, physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness have been strongly associated with a decreased risk of morbidity and mortality in those with Type 2 diabetes. Despite a wealth of evidence for Type 2 diabetes, less is understood about the therapeutic potential of physical activity in Type 1 diabetes. This article is protected by copyright.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and end organ failure, and is often found concomitant with disorders characteristic of the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), including obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. While the associated features often occur together, the pathway(s) or mechanism(s) linking hypertension in MetS are not well understood. Previous work determined that genetic variation on rat chromosome 17 (RNO17) contributes to several MetS-defining traits (including hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia) in the Lyon Hypertensive (LH) rat, a genetically determined MetS model. We hypothesized that at least some of the traits on RNO17 are controlled by a single gene with pleiotropic effects. To address this hypothesis, consomic and congenic strains were developed, whereby a defined fragment of RNO17 from the LH rat was substituted with the control Lyon Normotensive (LN) rat, and MetS phenotypes were measured in the resultant progeny. Compared to LH rats, LH-17LN consomic rats have significantly reduced body weight, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. A congenic strain (LH-17LNc), with a substituted fragment at the distal end of RNO17 (17q12.3; 74-97 Mb; rn4 assembly), showed differences from the LH rat in blood pressure and serum total cholesterol and triglycerides. Interestingly, there was no difference in body weight between the LH-17LNc and the parental LH rat. These data indicate that blood pressure and serum lipids are regulated by a gene(s) in the distal congenic interval, and could be due to pleiotropy. The data also indicate that body weight is not determined by the same gene(s) at this locus. Interestingly, only two small haplotypes spanning a total of approximately 0.5 Mb differ between the LH and LN genomes in the congenic interval. Genes in these haplotypes are strong candidate genes for causing dyslipidemia in the LH rat. Overall, MetS, even in a simplified genetic model such as the LH-17LN rat, is likely due to both independent and pleiotropic gene effects.
High-protein diets (HPDs) are associated with greater satiety and weight loss than diets rich in other macronutrients. The exact mechanisms by which HPDs exert their effects are unclear. However, evidence suggests that the sensing of amino acids produced as a result of protein digestion may have a role in appetite regulation and satiety. We investigated the effects of l-phenylalanine (L-Phe) on food intake and glucose homeostasis in rodents.
Shen Yuan et al. [1] highlight the protective cardiometabolic effects of chocolate intake. Without doubt, their work contributes to support evidence about the salutary and wide protective effects of chocolate compounds, particularly flavanols and its derivatives.[...].
Cardio-metabolic disease, namely ischemic heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, represent substantial health and economic burdens. Almost one half of cardio-metabolic deaths in the U.S. might be prevented through proper nutrition. Plant-based (vegetarian and vegan) diets are an effective strategy for improving nutrient intake. At the same time, they are associated with decreased all-cause mortality and decreased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Evidence suggests that plant-based diets may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease events by an estimated 40% and the risk of cerebral vascular disease events by 29%. These diets also reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes by about one half. Properly planned vegetarian diets are healthful, effective for weight and glycemic control, and provide metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, including reversing atherosclerosis and decreasing blood lipids and blood pressure. The use of plant-based diets as a means of prevention and treatment of cardio-metabolic disease should be promoted through dietary guidelines and recommendations.
According to life history theory, increased investment in reproductive function (physiology and behaviour) at different times throughout the life course affects the risk of many diseases and, ultimately, longevity. Although genetic factors contribute to interindividual and interpopulation variation in reproductive traits, the dominant source of variability is phenotypic plasticity during development and adult life. Reproductive traits in both sexes evolved sensitivity to ecological conditions, as reflected in contemporary associations of hormone concentrations with geographical setting, nutritional status, and physical activity level. Lifetime exposure to increased concentrations of sex hormones is associated with the risk of some cancers, hence decreasing fertility patterns contribute to secular increases in their incidence. Conversely, increased investment in reproductive function might compromise somatic investment in health, such that faster sexual maturation and higher parity increases risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. An evolutionary perspective on reproductive biology could improve the efficacy of public health efforts to reduce the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers and other non-communicable diseases.
Women with early or normal onset menopause are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those with late onset menopause, according to researchers who say more studies are needed to see if the findings can help with diabetes prediction and prevention.
To assess the impact of Medicaid prescription copayment policies on antipsychotic and other medication use among patients with schizophrenia.
Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid plant extract that is widely available as a dietary supplement in the United States and has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Because of its increased use and purported pharmacological properties, potential variations in product quality could pose a barrier to berberine's safety and effectiveness in clinical practice. Thus, this study evaluated the potency of dietary supplements containing berberine available in the U.S. commercial market. Fifteen unique dietary supplements containing berberine were purchased through U.S. dietary supplement vendors. For each product, berberine was extracted from 3 unique capsules and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Percentage content based on the product label claim was determined for each product. The average berberine content across the products was found to be 75% � 25% of the product label claim, with product potency ranging from 33% to 100%. Nine of the 15 tested products (60%) failed to meet the potency standards of 90% to 110% of labeled content claim, as commonly required of pharmaceutical preparations by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention. Evaluation of the relationship between product cost and the measured potency failed to demonstrate an association between quality and cost. Variability in product quality may significantly contribute to inconsistencies in the safety and effectiveness of berberine. In addition, the quality of the berberine product cannot be inferred from its cost.
This study investigates the protective effect of Rosa damascena essential oil on diabetes-induced testicular damage in rats. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 equal groups: Group I: negative control (no treatment); Group II: positive control (diabetic by alloxan injection); Groups III-VI that rendered diabetic and received, respectively, 50, 100, 200, and 400��g/kg/day rose oil, orally for 28�days. Rose oil did not significantly change body weight and blood glucose level as compared to positive control. Serum testosterone level of rose oil-treated rats remained statistically the same with both negative and positive control groups (Groups I and II). Rats treated with rose oil especially at 2 higher dosages (Groups V and VI) had higher sperm count and increased diameters of seminiferous tubules as compared to Group II. Rose oil even at the lowest dosage significantly increased cell count of spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells, with better outcomes for higher dosages. It appears that short-term repeated dose administration of rose oil can dose-dependently improve structural deteriorations of testes and epididymal sperm count in diabetic rats.
Conventionally, diabetes management involved targeting the triad of FPG, PPG, and HbA1c. However, several studies have suggested the quintessential need for a paradigm shift to incorporate glycemic variability and quality of life in the holistic diabetes control regimen.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has attained epidemic proportions and continues to increase despite the availability of a number of oral antidiabetic medications and major advances made in insulin delivery since its discovery nearly a hundred years ago. One, amongst many other reasons responsible for the inability to achieve adequate glycaemic control in a substantial proportion of T2DM patients is the delayed initiation and inappropriate intensification of insulin treatment. Appropriate initiation and intensification of insulin is critical for the successful achievement of tight glycaemic control.
Survey of Assessment and MAnagement of CoRonary Heart Disease PaTients was undertaken to describe profile and management pattern of adult Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients from presentation till discharge, in private tertiary care Indian hospitals.
Many clinical guidelines recommend apolipoprotein B (apoB) measurement, particularly in subjects with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. Recently, we developed a new equation to estimate serum apoB (apoBE). We validated the clinical relevance of apoBE and compared the performance of the equation with conventional lipid measurements and direct measurement of apoB.
Ageing is the predominant risk factor for many common diseases. Human premature ageing diseases are powerful model systems to identify and characterize cellular mechanisms that underpin physiological ageing. Their study also leads to a better understanding of the causes, drivers and potential therapeutic strategies of common diseases associated with ageing, including neurological disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Using the rare premature ageing disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome as a paradigm, we discuss here the shared mechanisms between premature ageing and ageing-associated diseases, including defects in genetic, epigenetic and metabolic pathways; mitochondrial and protein homeostasis; cell cycle; and stem cell-regenerative capacity.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have contributed significantly to the understanding of complex disease genetics. However, GWAS only report association signals and do not necessarily identify culprit genes. As most signals occur in non-coding regions of the genome, it is often challenging to assign genomic variants to the underlying causal mechanism(s). Topologically associating domains (TADs) are primarily cell-type-independent genomic regions that define interactome boundaries and can aid in the designation of limits within which an association most likely impacts gene function. We describe and validate a computational method that uses the genic content of TADs to prioritize candidate genes. Our method, called 'TAD_Pathways', performs a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis over genes that reside within TAD boundaries corresponding to GWAS signals for a given trait or disease. Applying our pipeline to the bone mineral density (BMD) GWAS catalog, we identify 'Skeletal System Development' (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P=1.02x10(-5)) as the top-ranked pathway. In many cases, our method implicated a gene other than the nearest gene. Our molecular experiments describe a novel example: ACP2, implicated near the canonical 'ARHGAP1' locus. We found ACP2 to be an important regulator of osteoblast metabolism, whereas ARHGAP1 was not supported. Our results via BMD, for example, demonstrate how basic principles of three-dimensional genome organization can define biologically informed association windows.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 9 August 2017; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2017.108.
to study the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with seborrheic keratomas (SK) and insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2)) and in those without concomitant carbohydrate metabolic disturbances.
As soon as the role of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in so-called civilization diseases, which include non-infectious chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes or high blood pressure has been discovered, and the possibility of employing antioxidants as a remedy for these diseases have been proposed, scientists developed a broad spectrum of methods to determine antioxidant activity of pure chemicals and plant extracts, as well as dietary supplements. Most of these methods are based on simple redox reactions between antioxidant and ROS (for example ABTS, DPPH, or FRAP tests). However, chemical methods of assessing antioxidant activity are rarely biologically relevant. They do not mirror the real effect of antioxidants in living organisms, because they are used in non-physiological conditions of temperature and pH; neither they take metabolism nor intracellular transport under consideration. The perfect model for assessment of antioxidant activity in living organisms would be human or animal model, but such determinations are very complicated and often ambiguous. The current best alternative to chemical and human tests are assays employing cell culture models being less expensive than human tests, yet still reflecting biological systems more convincingly than chemical assays. Cellular antioxidant assays are performed under physiological pH and temperature, but most importantly, they take metabolism and intracellular transport under consideration. In this review, we present cellular tests used to determine antioxidant activity that are based on luminescence and fluorescence methods.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is currently the leading cause of menstrual complications in women. It is characterized by clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulation abnormalities and the presence of enlarged and/or polycystic ovaries in ultrasound images (12 or more small bubbles located circumferentially and/or ovarian volume > 10 mL). It is often comorbid with hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, overweight or obesity, and is a risk factor for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The treatment of patients with PCOS depends on the prevailing symptoms. The aim of this paper is to present the etiopathogenesis, clinical and biochemical implications, and non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment options - those approved by worldwide scientific organizations as well as new therapies whose initial results are encouraging enough to prompt researchers to explore them further.
Cardiovascular (CV) incidents are the major cause of mortality in maintenance dialysis (MD) patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD). CV injury indicators may be useful to investigate the dialysis modality influence on survival.
The current level of knowledge indicates a relationship between periodontitis and diabetes and/or cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Periodontitis can be not only a risk factor for these diseases, but also a condition modifying other primary risk factors associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular complications (lipid disorders, arterial hypertension, etc.) or diabetes.
Sulfonylurea therapy can improve glycemic control and ameliorate neurodevelopmental outcomes in patients suffering from neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) with KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutations. As genetic testing results are often delayed, it remains controversial whether sulfonylurea treatment should be attempted immediately at diagnosis or doctors should await genetic confirmation.
Metformin is an AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activator that plays a role in glucose energy metabolism and cell protection. It is widely used to treat several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and metabolic diseases. In this study, we investigated whether AMPK activation upon treatment with metformin may promote neurite outgrowth during the progression of neuronal differentiation in human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). Differentiation of metformin-treated MSCs (Met-MSCs to Met-diMSCs) in the neuronal induction media resulted in an increase in the number of differentiated cells in a metformin concentration-dependent manner. The differentiation rate reached its maximum at 3 h after the initial treatment with neuronal induction media. At 3 h of induction, the neurite length increased significantly in Met-diMSCs as compared with control cells without metformin treatment (diMSCs). diMSCs showed a significant increase in the expression of neuronal-specific marker genes; however, the expression of dendrite-specific markers MAP-2 and Tuj-1 was significantly increased in Met-diMSCs as compared to diMSCs, as confirmed by immunoblotting. This effect was abolished upon treatment with the AMPK inhibitor, compound C, as evident by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemical staining. Thus, metformin treatment promotes neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth in hBM-MSCs through AMPK activation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Non-persistence with secondary preventive measures, including medications such as statins, adversely affects the prospects of successful outcomes. This study was aimed at evaluating non-persistence with statin therapy in cohorts of young and elderly patients after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and identifying patient-associated characteristics that influence the risk for non-persistence.
Air pollution is known to be a major risk factor for cardiopulmonary disease, but this is unclear for cardiometabolic disease (e.g. diabetes). This is of considerable public health importance, given the nationwide epidemic of diabetes, accompanied by severe air pollution, in China. The evidence so far remained inadequate to answer questions of whether individuals with cardiometabolic dysfunctions are susceptible to air pollution and whether air pollution exacerbates diabetes development via certain biological pathways. In this manuscript, we summarize the results and limitations of studies exploring these two topics and elaborate our design of a prospective panel study (SCOPE) as a solution. We assessed and compared the health effect of air pollution among pre-diabetic individuals and matched healthy controls through four repeated clinical visits over 1 year. Comprehensive evaluation was made to both health endpoints and exposure. The primary biomarkers were assessed to reveal the impact on multiple biological pathways, including glycolipid metabolism and insulin resistance, endothelial function, and inflammation. Detailed chemical and size fractional components of particulate matter were measured in this study, along with the application of personal monitors. The work should increase our understanding of how air pollution affects individuals with cardiometabolic dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms.
Traditional methods of health surveillance often under-represent racial and ethnic minorities. Our objective was to use geospatial analysis and emergency claims data to estimate local chronic disease prevalence separately for specific racial and ethnic groups. We also performed a regression analysis to identify associations between median household income and local disease prevalence among Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White adults in New York City. The study population included individuals who visited an emergency department at least once from 2009 to 2013. Our main outcomes were geospatial estimates of diabetes, hypertension, and asthma prevalence by Census tract as stratified by race and ethnicity. Using emergency claims data, we identified 4.9 million unique New York City adults with 28.5% of identifying as Black, 25.2% Hispanic, and 6.1% Asian. Age-adjusted disease prevalence was highest among Black and Hispanic adults for diabetes (13.4 and 13.1%), hypertension (28.7 and 24.1%), and asthma (9.9 and 10.1%). Correlation between disease prevalence maps demonstrated moderate overlap between Black and Hispanic adults for diabetes (0.49), hypertension (0.57), and asthma (0.58). In our regression analysis, we found that the association between low income and high disease prevalence was strongest for Hispanic adults, whereas increases in income had more modest reductions in disease prevalence for Black adults, especially for diabetes. Our geographically detailed maps of disease prevalence generate actionable evidence that can help direct health interventions to those communities with the highest health disparities. Using these novel geographic approaches, we reveal the underlying epidemiology of chronic disease for a racially and culturally diverse population.
The current standard therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is insulin replacement. Autoimmune diseases are typically treated with broad immunosuppression, but this has multiple disadvantages. Induction of antigen-specific tolerance is preferable. The application of nanomedicine to the problem of T1D can take different forms, but one promising way is the development of tolerogenic nanoparticles, the aim of which is to mitigate the islet-destroying autoimmunity. We review the topic and highlight recent strategies to produce tolerogenic nanoparticles for the purpose of treating T1D.
Higher health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in dialysis patients has been associated with fewer hospitalizations and lower mortality. Since Arab patients on dialysis have better survival rates than Jewish patients, we hypothesized that they would have higher HRQOL. We also studied the impact of several risk factors on HRQOL in each population.
Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) provide important cardiovascular risk information for dialysis patients. This study aims to evaluate the risk factors of cfPWV and the associations between ambulatory blood pressure, especially night-time blood pressure and cfPWV.
Fatty pancreas is a newly recognized condition which is poorly investigated until today as compared to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is characterized by pancreatic fat accumulation and subsequent development of pancreatic and metabolic complications. Association of fatty pancreas have been described with type 2 diabetes mellitus, acute and chronic pancreatitis and even pancreatic carcinoma. In this review article, we provide an update on clinical implications, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes.
Predicting glucose values on the basis of insulin and food intakes is a difficult task that people with diabetes need to do daily. This is necessary as it is important to maintain glucose levels at appropriate values to avoid not only short-term, but also long-term complications of the illness. Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning techniques in particular have already lead to promising results in modeling and predicting glucose concentrations. In this work, several machine learning techniques are used for the modeling and prediction of glucose concentrations using as inputs the values measured by a continuous monitoring glucose system as well as also previous and estimated future carbohydrate intakes and insulin injections. In particular, we use the following four techniques: genetic programming, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and grammatical evolution. We propose two new enhanced modeling algorithms for glucose prediction, namely (i) a variant of grammatical evolution which uses an optimized grammar, and (ii) a variant of tree-based genetic programming which uses a three-compartment model for carbohydrate and insulin dynamics. The predictors were trained and tested using data of ten patients from a public hospital in Spain. We analyze our experimental results using the Clarke error grid metric and see that 90% of the forecasts are correct (i.e., Clarke error categories A and B), but still even the best methods produce 5 to 10% of serious errors (category D) and approximately 0.5% of very serious errors (category E). We also propose an enhanced genetic programming algorithm that incorporates a three-compartment model into symbolic regression models to create smoothed time series of the original carbohydrate and insulin time series.
The purpose of this review is to determine the prevalence of uveitis in the diabetic population, the clinical features of the uveitis and diabetes when coexisting and pathophysiology of a possible correlation. We also aim to review the cases of diabetes and uveitis in the literature.
To study the epidemiology of patients with endogenous endophthalmitis in Denmark.
Obesity-linked ectopic fat accumulation is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. Whether pancreatic and liver steatosis impairs insulin secretion is controversial. We examined the crosstalk of human pancreatic fat cells with islets and the role of diabetogenic factors, i.e. palmitate and fetuin-A, a hepatokine released from fatty liver.
To quantify extracellular matrix expansion with the cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping technique and the derived extracellular volume fraction (ECV) in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM) patients and to detect the relationship among ECV, duration of diabetes, and diastolic function.
Nowadays, the society is facing a large health problem with the rising of new diseases, including cancer, heart diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and obesity. Thus, it is important to invest in substances that enhance the health of the population. In this context, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a flavonoid found in many plants, especially in tea. Several studies support the notion that EGCG has several benefits in fighting cancer, heart diseases, diabetes, and obesity, among others. Nevertheless, the poor intestinal absorbance and instability of EGCG constitute the main drawback to use this molecule in prevention and therapy. The encapsulation of EGCG in nanocarriers leads to its enhanced stability and higher therapeutic effects. A comprehensive review of studies currently available on the encapsulation of EGCG by means of nanocarriers will be addressed.

Background: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can improve several aspects of cardiometabolic health. Previous studies have suggested that adaptations to exercise training can be augmented with post-exercise milk or protein consumption, but whether this nutritional strategy can impact the cardiometabolic adaptations to HIIT in type 2 diabetes is unknown. Objective: To determine if the addition of a post-exercise milk or protein beverage to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention improves cardiometabolic health in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Design: In a proof-of-concept, double-blind clinical trial 53 adults with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes were randomized to one of three nutritional beverages (500 mL skim-milk, macronutrient control, or flavored water placebo) consumed after exercise (3 days/week) during a 12 week low-volume HIIT intervention. HIIT involved 10 X 1-min high-intensity intervals separated by 1-min low-intensity recovery periods. Two sessions per week were cardio-based (at ~90% of heart rate max) and one session involved resistance-based exercises (at RPE of 5-6; CR-10 scale) in the same interval pattern. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), cardiorespiratory fitness ([Formula: see text]), blood pressure, and endothelial function (%FMD) were measured before and after the intervention. Results: There were significant main effects of time (all p < 0.05) but no difference between groups (Interaction: all p > 0.71) for CGM 24-h mean glucose (-0.5 � 1.1 mmol/L), HbA1c (-0.2 � 0.4%), percent body fat (-0.8 � 1.6%), and lean mass (+1.1 � 2.8 kg). Similarly, [Formula: see text] (+2.5 � 1.6 mL/kg/min) and %FMD (+1.4 � 1.9%) were increased, and mean arterial blood pressure reduced (-6 � 7 mmHg), after 12 weeks of HIIT (all p < 0.01) with no difference between beverage groups (Interaction: all p > 0.11). Conclusion: High-intensity interval training is a potent stimulus for improving several important metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes. The benefits of HIIT are not augmented by the addition of post-exercise protein.
Sucralose is the most widely used artificial sweetener, and its health effects have been highly debated over the years. In particular, previous studies have shown that sucralose consumption can alter the gut microbiota. The gut microbiome plays a key role in processes related to host health, such as food digestion and fermentation, immune cell development, and enteric nervous system regulation. Inflammation is one of the most common effects associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, which has been linked to a series of human diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the structural and functional effects of sucralose on the gut microbiota and associated inflammation in the host. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice received sucralose in their drinking water for 6 months. The difference in gut microbiota composition and metabolites between control and sucralose-treated mice was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, functional gene enrichment analysis and metabolomics. Inflammatory gene expression in tissues was analyzed by RT-PCR. Alterations in bacterial genera showed that sucralose affects the gut microbiota and its developmental dynamics. Enrichment of bacterial pro-inflammatory genes and disruption in fecal metabolites suggest that 6-month sucralose consumption at the human acceptable daily intake (ADI) may increase the risk of developing tissue inflammation by disrupting the gut microbiota, which is supported by elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression in the liver of sucralose-treated mice. Our results highlight the role of sucralose-gut microbiome interaction in regulating host health-related processes, particularly chronic inflammation.
Diabetes mellitus has been demonstrated to be closely associated with osteoporosis. Accordingly, hypoglycemic therapy is considered effective in treating metabolic bone disease. Recently, the effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a new type of antidiabetic drug, on bone metabolism have been widely studied. This review mainly describes the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on bone metabolism, including their effects on bone mineral density, bone quality, and fracture risk. In addition, the potential underlying mechanisms are discussed. Based on the current progress in this research field, DPP-4 inhibitors have been proved to reduce fracture risk. In addition, sitagliptin, a strong and highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor, showed its beneficial effects on bone metabolism by improving bone mineral density, bone quality, and bone markers. With regard to the potential underlying mechanisms, DPP-4 inhibitors may promote bone formation and reduce bone resorption through DPP-4 substrates and DPP-4-related energy metabolism. Vitamin D and other related signaling pathways also play a role in affecting bone metabolism. Although these assumptions are controversial, they provide a translational pharmacology approach for the clinical use of DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of metabolic diseases. Prior to the use of these drugs in clinic, further studies should be conducted to determine the appropriate type of DPP-4 inhibitor, the people who would benefit the most from this therapy, appropriate dose and duration, and the effects of the treatment.
Primary insomnia (PI) may increase diabetes risk. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of PI on glucose metabolism could be improved by 2 months of pharmacological treatment.
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders that are caused by deficiency in insulin secretion or the decreased ability of insulin to act effectively on target tissues, particularly muscle, liver, and fat. As a result of insulin resistance in the target tissues, particularly in the adipocytes, free fatty acid flux is increased, leading to increased lipid synthesis in hepatocytes, which is responsible for diabetic dyslipidemia.
The global prevalence and impact of diabetes has increased dramatically, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This region faces unique challenges in combating the disease including lack of funding for noncommunicable diseases, lack of availability of studies and guidelines specific to the population, lack of availability of medications, differences in urban and rural patients, and inequity between public and private sector health care. Because of these challenges, diabetes has a greater impact on morbidity and mortality related to the disease in sub-Saharan Africa than any other region in the world. In order to address these unacceptably poor trends, contextualized strategies for the prevention, identification, management, and financing of diabetes care within this population must be developed. This narrative review provides insights into the policy landscape, epidemiology, pathophysiology, care protocols, medication availability, and health care systems to give readers a comprehensive summary of many factors in these domains as they pertain to diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to providing a review of the current evidence available in these domains, potential solutions to address the major gaps in care will be proposed to reverse the negative trends seen with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.
Given that the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is given at an increasingly less-symptomatic phase, and the literature data on the cardiovascular risk of patients with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT) are controversial, the coronary calcium score (CCS), which is correlated with coronary artery disease, may be useful for clarifying the association between cardiovascular risk and NPHPT.
Conjunctival microangiopathy has been described among diabetics similar to retinal vessel angiopathy. Correlation of these conjunctival microangiopathy changes with retinopathy may form the basis of screening by external examination without expert fundus evaluation.
Stroke is one of the largest socio medical problems of modern times. In addition to the third leading cause of death, it is the first cause of non-trauma disability. Numerous studies show a correlation of risk factors and arteriosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries and carotid arteries.
Primary care manages >90% of illnesses requiring medical services in Hong Kong, in which 9,513 registered Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs) provide 8.2% of the consultations. This is the first study aimed to determine the morbidity pattern in different Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) primary care settings in Chinese population. 55,312 patients' encounters were classified by the International Classification of Primary Care-2 (ICPC-2) from 260 of CMPs. Mean patient age was 50.5 years, with more females than males (67.0% vs 33.0%). Most patients consulted CMPs for chronic (64% vs 33.7%) rather than acute conditions. Among the 30% of patients, hypertension (49.5%) or diabetes (18.5%) were the most common co-morbidity. The most common problems presenting to CMP were respiratory (24.9%), musculoskeletal complaints (22.7%), cough (11.7%), and lower back pain (6.6%). To our knowledge, this was the first study permitting direct comparison with that presenting to Western medicine (WM) primary care by ICPC-2 systems. The results confirmed the role of CMP in primary care for musculoskeletal or chronic illnesses that they may have also received conventional WM treatment. We recommend greater effort and more resources should be invested to promote interdisciplinary communication to ensure safety and synergy of TCM and WM in primary care.
Vacuum-assisted closure(VAC) therapy is mainly used for tissue defects. VAC therapy can remove exudate that could impair the healing process. We applied VAC therapy in patients considered at high risk of surgical site infection who underwent cardiovascular surgery via standard median sternotomy. Risk factors included advanced heart failure, obesity, diabetes mellitus, steroid administration, immunosuppressant administration, and chronic renal failure, etc. VAC therapy was used in 134 patients. Only 3 of these patients (2.2%) developed surgical site infection caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis;2 patients fully recovered after prolonged VAC therapy for 2 weeks, and the other required an additional sternal fixation after the sternal wires were removed for wound infection control. No patient developed infective mediastinitis. Prophylactic VAC therapy can reduce postoperative wound infection in high risk patients undergoing open heart surgery via full sternotomy.
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex and chronic metabolic disorder leading to many complications. One of the most common complications of DM is diabetic neuropathy. There are many studies exploring corneal sensitivity as a potential marker of diabetic neuropathy. This review aims to explore association between corneal sensitivity and diabetic neuropathy. In diabetic neuropathy, corneal sensitivity is impaired due to low level of corneal nerve trophic factors, impaired sensory nerve fibers, and lost communication of dendtritic cell. In diabetic patients, this condition can be assessed by several techniques, such as Cochet Bonnet aesthesiometry, non-contact corneal aesthesiometry, and confocal microscopy. Few promising therapeutic targets for impaired corneal sensitivity include stem cell and growth factor therapy that can be used to prevent complication in patient with diabetic neurotrophic keratopathy. Impaired corneal sensitivity serve as a potential marker of diabetic neuropathy. Doctors, opthalmologists and internists, should anticipate the possibility of observing the following changes in diabetic patients with neuropathy by using corneal sensitivity assessment test.
the risk of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is increasing in patients with type-2 diabetes. Prevalence and factors related to the increased risk of NAFLD in diabetic patients in Indonesia has never been studied before. Data regarding the profile of fibrosis in the population has also been unknown. This study aimed to identify the difference on the profile of diabetic patients with and without NAFLD as well as the degree of fibrosis.
The predictive value of fractional flow reserve (FFR) measured immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent placement has not been prospectively investigated. We investigated the potential of post-PCI FFR measurements to predict clinical outcome in patients from FAME 1 and 2 trials (Fractional Flow Reserve or Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation).
To test the association of a recently reported variant in the creatine kinase (CK) muscle gene, CKM Glu83Gly (rs11559024) with constitutive creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels, CK variation, and inducibility. Given the diagnostic importance of CK in determining muscle damage, we tested the association of the variant with myalgia.
Islet amyloid and beta cell death in type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous events, where some islets are affected early in the disease process whereas others remain visibly unaffected. This study investigated the possibility that inter-islet functional and vascular differences may explain the propensity for amyloid accumulation in certain islets. Highly blood perfused islets were identified by microspheres in human islet amyloid polypeptide expressing mice fed a high-fat diet for three or 10 months. These highly blood perfused islets had better glucose-stimulated insulin secretion capacity than other islets, and developed more amyloid deposits after 10 months of high-fat diet. Similarly, human islets with a superior release capacity formed more amyloid in high-glucose culture than islets with a lower release capacity. The amyloid formation in mouse islets was associated with a higher amount of prohormone convertase 1/3 and with a decreased expression of its inhibitor proSAAS when compared to islets with less amyloid. In contrast, levels of prohormone convertase 2 and expression of its inhibitor neuroendocrine protein 7B2 were unaltered. A misbalance in prohormone convertase levels may interrupt the normal processing of islet amyloid polypeptide and induce amyloid formation. Preferential amyloid load in the most blood perfused and functional islets may accelerate the progression of type 2 diabetes.
Amifostine is a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species that is used for the salivary gland protection during therapy with radioactive iodine for thyroid cancer. There are no data on the potential effect of amifostine on thyroid cancer cells.
Targeted protein degradation through ubiquitination is an important step in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Here we present evidence that the DDB1-CUL4A ubiquitin E3 ligase functions as a novel metabolic regulator that promotes FOXO1-driven hepatic gluconeogenesis. In vivo, hepatocyte-specific Ddb1 deletion leads to impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis in the mouse liver but protects mice from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperglycemia. Lack of Ddb1 downregulates FOXO1 protein expression and impairs FOXO1-driven gluconeogenic response. Mechnistically, we discovered that DDB1 enhances FOXO1 protein stability via degrading the circadian protein cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), a known target of DDB1 E3 ligase. In the Cry1 depletion condition, insulin fails to reduce the nuclear FOXO1 abundance and suppress gluconeogenic gene expression. Chronic depletion of Cry1 in the mouse liver not only increases FOXO1 protein but also enhances hepatic gluconeogenesis. Thus, we have identified the DDB1-mediated CRY1 degradation as an important target of insulin action on glucose homeostatsis.
Rigorous evidence is lacking whether online games can improve patients' longer-term health outcomes. We investigated whether an online team-based game delivering diabetes self-management education (DSME) to patients via e-mail or mobile app can generate longer-term improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
Pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC) harbour recurrent functional mutations of the master DNA damage response kinase ATM which has been shown to accelerate tumorigenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. To study how ATM deficiency affects genome integrity in this setting, we evaluated the molecular and functional effects of conditional Atm deletion in a mouse model of PDAC. ATM deficiency was associated with increased mitotic defects, recurrent genomic rearrangements and deregulated DNA integrity checkpoints, reminiscent of human PDAC. We hypothesized that altered genome integrity might allow synthetic lethality-based options for targeted therapeutic intervention. Supporting this possibility, we found that the PARP inhibitor olaparib or ATR inhibitors reduced the viability of PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo associated with a genotype-selective increase in apoptosis. Overall, our results offered a preclinical mechanistic rationale for the use of PARP and ATR inhibitors to improve treatment of ATM-mutant PDAC.
The invasive physiologic index such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is used in clinical practice to identify ischemia-causing stenosis and to guide treatment strategy. We investigated clinical and angiographic characteristics of lesions with discrepancy between FFR and iFR.
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health problem in Sudan and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of complications of type 2 diabetes across different cities in the country.
Previous studies have identified preterm birth and/or small for gestational age (SGA) as risk factors for features of the metabolic syndrome, including high blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and atherosclerosis, occurring later in life, with controversial results. We conducted this population-based cohort study to investigate metabolic outcomes in those with former preterm birth and/or SGA status in Taiwan.
The influence of childhood health on later-life health outcomes is increasingly hypothesized but rarely tested. We examined the relationship between cardiometabolic indicators in childhood and risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes.
Social support is linked to improved glycemic control and psychosocial well-being of patients diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose was to critically evaluate the psychometric properties of social support measures used in this population.
Previously, we have reported that daily glucose fluctuations could affect coronary plaque vulnerability, but the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. This study sought to investigate the impact of CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes on plaque vulnerability, as assessed by virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS), as well as their relationship to fluctuating glucose levels in patients with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).
The current global rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes are staggering. In order to implement effective management strategies, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of obesity-induced insulin resistance and diabetes. Macrophage infiltration and inflammation of the adipose tissue in obesity is a well-established paradigm, yet the role of macrophages in muscle inflammation, insulin resistance and diabetes is not adequately studied. In this systematic review, we will examine the evidence for the presence of macrophages in skeletal muscle of obese humans and mice, and will assess the association between muscle macrophages and insulin resistance. We will identify published studies that address muscle macrophage content and phenotype, and its association with insulin resistance. We will search MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for eligible studies. Grey literature will be searched in ProQuest. Quality assessment will be conducted using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias Tool for animal studies.
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), an acute phase protein released by neutrophils, has been described as biomarker of inflammatory states. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by increased inflammation and an elevated risk for embolization of carotid artery stenosis (CAS). We aimed to explore the role of NGAL systemically and in plaques of diabetics undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Moreover, the potential anti-inflammatory effect of metformin on NGAL was addressed in diabetics.
High mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) is a nuclear protein also acting as inflammatory mediator, whilst osteoprotegerin (OPG), member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is indicated as marker of vascular calcification. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are clinical conditions characterized by elevated serum inflammatory markers and vascular calcification enhancement. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of HMGB-1, OPG and several inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (HsCRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on the presence and severity of peripheral artery disease in patients with T2D.
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to present with multiple vessel lesions during coronary angiography. The underlying mechanism remains elusive and there is a shortage of serum prediction markers. In this study, we investigate the relationship between admission HbA1c and severity of coronary artery stenosis and subsequent prognosis in AMI patients with or without diabetes.
Glutathione plays crucial roles in the detoxification and antioxidant systems of cells and has been used to treat acute poisoning and chronic liver diseases by intravenous injection. This is a first study examining the therapeutic effects of oral administration of glutathione in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Fasting glucose and fasting insulin are glycemic traits closely related to diabetes, and understanding the role of genetic factors in these traits can help reveal the etiology of type 2 diabetes. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several candidate genes have been found to be associated with fasting glucose and fasting insulin, copy number variations (CNVs), which have been reported to be associated with several complex traits, have not been reported for association with these two traits. We aimed to identify CNVs associated with fasting glucose and fasting insulin.
Management practices of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) were compared between two areas with similar healthcare structure and low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.
Current clinical guidelines of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) recommend the use of potent antiplatelet therapy, prasugrel or ticagrelor, because both drugs consistently reduce cardiovascular events.
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, in subjects aged 60 years or older with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: Data from eight 24-week, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies were analyzed. Patients aged 60 years or older with T2DM were received oral linagliptin (5 mg/d) or placebo in combination with metformin, or metformin plus sulfonylurea. Efficacy was assessed by the changes in glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) from baseline to 24 weeks of treatment. Safety endpoint included the frequency and intensity of adverse events. Results: A total of 1 421 patients (placebo 429, linagliptin 992) were included in the full analysis set (FAS). Mean ages of the subjects were (67.4�5.6) years in the linagliptin group and (66.7�5.6) years in the placebo group. Baseline HbA1c was (8.0�0.8) % in the linagliptin group and (8.1�0.9) % in the placebo group. At the end of 24-week, placebo-adjusted reduction in HbA1c in subjects with linagliptin was (0.7�0.1)% (95%CI 0.6-0.8, P<0.000 1), and placebo-adjusted reduction in FPG in subjects with linagliptin was (0.88�0.12) mmol/L(95%CI 0.65-1.11, P<0.000 1). Overall safety and tolerability in the two groups were similar. Adverse events occurred in 57.1% of patients in the placebo group and 61.1% of patients in the linagliptin group, and the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation was 3.2% in the placebo group and 3.8% in the linagliptin group. Serious adverse events occurred in 1.6% of patients in the placebo group and 2.8% of patients in the linagliptin group. Investigator-defined hypoglycaemia occurred in 7.3% of patients in the placebo group and 11.9% of patients in the linagliptin group. Among them, most were mild or moderate hypoglycaemia, and severe hypoglycaemia only occurred in 0.2% of patients in the placebo and 0.5% in the linagliptin groups. Overall incidence of hypoglycaemia in linagliptin group was slightly higher than that in placebo group, which might be due to the fact that more patients were taking sulfonylureas in linagliptin group than in placebo group (26.8% linagliptin; 18.4% placebo). No difference could be viewed in hypoglycaemia between the two groups in patients without sulfonylureas (1.2% linagliptin, 1.1% placebo). Moreover, no severe hypoglycaemia was reported in subjects without sulfonylureas. The incidences of other adverse events were similar in both groups. Conclusion: Linagliptin was efficacious in lowering glucose with a safety profile similar to placebo in type 2 diabetic patients aged 60 years or older.
Patinopecten yessoensis, is a species of scallop and a marine bivalve mollusk. In traditional East Asian medicine, scallop meat is used as a drug for the treatment of diabetes, pollakisuria, and indigestion. The present study was conducted in order to examine the potential anticancer effects of scallop flesh extract (SE) on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. An MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability and flow cytometry was used for the assessment of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The alteration in protein expression level was determined by western blot analysis, and the amounts of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in the SE were measured by gas chromatography. SE inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest. The cell cycle arrest was associated with the upregulation of p53 and p21, and downregulation of G1 phase-associated cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 and cyclin E1/Cdk 2. In addition, SE-mediated cell cycle arrest was associated with the promotion of apoptosis, as indicated by the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and changes in nuclear morphology. SE appeared to induce the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade, as indicated by a decreased expression of Bcl-2, activation of Bcl-2 associated X protein, release of cytochrome c, decrease in procaspase-3, and an increase in cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, the expression levels of Fas-associated via death domain and cleaved caspase-8 were increased in a SE dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis are associated with the anticancer effects of SE on MCF-7 cells. Thus, SE may be a suitable candidate for the treatment and prevention of human breast cancer.
Dear Editor, We read with interest the article by Gorelick et al. [1], who assayed the diabetogenic potential of two ancestral wheat landraces (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides and spp. dicoccum), compared to a modern wheat cultivar (T. aestivum) in NOD mice. [...].
In the following review, we evaluated the current literature and evidence-based data on transdermal magnesium application and show that the propagation of transdermal magnesium is scientifically unsupported. The importance of magnesium and the positive effects of magnesium supplementation are extensively documented in magnesium deficiency, e.g., cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The effectiveness of oral magnesium supplementation for the treatment of magnesium deficiency has been studied in detail. However, the proven and well-documented oral magnesium supplementation has become questioned in the recent years through intensive marketing for its transdermal application (e.g., magnesium-containing sprays, magnesium flakes, and magnesium salt baths). In both, specialist and lay press as well as on the internet, there are increasing numbers of articles claiming the effectiveness and superiority of transdermal magnesium over an oral application. It is claimed that the transdermal absorption of magnesium in comparison to oral application is more effective due to better absorption and fewer side effects as it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.
To assess the effects of each traditional cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and smoking), including the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and to assess the degree of carotid plaque occurrence.
Fragmented QRS (FQRS) in 12 lead ECG was recently correlated with various outcomes in ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease. We studied the relationship between FQRS and ejection fraction (EF) in heart failure patients with QRS�<�120�ms.
We investigated the effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on morbidity and mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) including patients on haemodialysis, often excluded from randomised trials.
We sought to identify prognostic factors of long-term mortality, specific for the underlying etiology of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF).
Pediatric catheterization exposes patients to varying radiation doses. Concerns over the effects of X-ray radiation dose on the patient population have increased in recent years. This study aims at quantifying the patient radiation dose reduction after the introduction of an X-ray imaging technology using advanced real time image noise reduction algorithms and optimized acquisition chain for fluoroscopy and exposure in a pediatric and adult population with congenital heart disease.
Cardiogenic shock is a serious complication of a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We compared short- and long-term mortality among (1) STEMI patients with and without cardiogenic shock and (2) STEMI patients with cardiogenic shock with and without the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).
Dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPLT) for at least 12�months is recommended after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation, but concerns regarding the extended use of this treatment persist due to increased risk of bleeding. In this study are assessed the incidence, correlates, and clinical significance of bleeding complications in diabetic patients after long-term DAPLT post DES implantation.
The management of mitral regurgitation (MR) is challenging - patients may be asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic, older with comorbidities, or clinically symptomatic and not appropriate for surgery. The current review assesses morbidity, mortality, and risk factors associated with functional and organic MR, with a focus on severe MR.
Although left ventricular (LV) global systolic longitudinal strain (GLS) reliably and accurately assesses LV systolic function and is also a powerful prognostic predictor, the importance and prognostic value of GLS in end-stage renal disease patients receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD) remain unclear. This study sought to determine the prognostic value of GLS in chronic PD patients.
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), either obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or central sleep apnoea (CSA)/Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) and often a combination of the two, is highly prevalent in patients with heart failure (HF), is associated with reduced functional capacity and quality of life, and has a negative prognostic impact. European HF guidelines identify that sleep apnoea is of concern in patients with HF. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice for OSA, and adaptive servoventilation (ASV) appears to be the most consistently effective therapy for CSA/CSR while also being able to treat concomitant obstructive events. There is a growing body of evidence that treating SDB in patients with HF, particularly using ASV for CSA/CSR, improves functional outcomes such as HF symptoms, cardiac function, cardiac disease markers, exercise tolerance and quality of life. However, conflicting results have been reported on 'hard' outcomes such as mortality and healthcare utilisation, and the influence of effectively treating SDB, including CSA/CSR, remains to be determined in randomised clinical trials. Two such trials (SERVE-HF and ADVENT-HF) in chronic stable HF and another in post-acute decompensated HF (CAT-HF) are currently underway.
Heart failure and diabetes mellitus contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of the US population. The combined economic impact on the US health care system reaches nearly $300 billion. Much of this cost stems from the frequent hospital admissions and direct cost of managing the two diseases. The presence of diabetes significantly increases the risk of developing heart failure compared to the general population and diabetics with heart failure experience significantly higher mortality. Patients with heart failure have a high incidence of insulin resistance and are at increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Traditionally these two chronic illnesses have been managed in relative isolation. However the adverse effects of each disease has significant impact on the other. The combination of heart failure and diabetes mellitus significantly increases the morbidity and mortality compared to either in isolation. This paper reviews the epidemiology and impact of the bidirectional effects of these two chronic illnesses.
Correct subtyping of primary aldosteronism (PA) is essential for good surgical outcomes. Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) and/or computed tomography (CT) are used for PA sub-classification. Clinical and/or biochemical improvement after surgery, however, is not always achieved in patients with presumed unilateral PA. We aimed to identify the pitfalls in PA sub-classification leading to surgical treatment failures.
One of the most commonly identified chronic illnesses in many countries is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM denotes an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Heart disease is one of the causes of mortality in patients with diabetes, mainly due to the macrovascular complications. One of these macrovascular complications in diabetes is atherosclerosis, which involves a complicated pathophysiological process. Besides hyperglycemia, oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its associated risk of CVD. There are many other factors including molecular, metabolic, lipid, fibrinolytic, and platelet function disorders precipitate to thrombotic and CVD risks in T2DM. Also, Platelets have an increased response to procoagulants in patients with diabetes. Platelet hyperactivity, in the presence of oxidative stress, has a major effect on the progression of thrombotic and CVD events. This review will discuss the impact of the above factors and the potential effects of platelet hyperactivity on thrombotic and cardiovascular risks.
Environmental exposure to metals may adversely affect cardiometabolic health. However, little data are available directly evaluating the roles of metal exposure in blood glucose of which dysfunction has been linked to diabetes. We aimed to evaluate the dose-response associations between fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and multiple urinary metals including nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, and arsenic, as well as to examine their joint effects among occupational workers.
Sympatho-adrenal responses are activated as an innate defense coping (DefS) mechanism during emotional stress. Whether these sympatho-adrenal responses drive cardiac troponin T (cTnT) increases are unknown. Therefore, associations between cTnT and sympatho-adrenal responses were assessed.
Everyday discrimination may contribute to incident metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the U.S. and related racial/ethnic differences in MetS. This study investigated whether ED predicted MetS in a diverse sample.
The aim of our study is to assess the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and advanced hepatic fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using simple noninvasive scores.
Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). OPG has also been associated with fibrosis and collagen cross-linking, which increase arterial and left ventricle (LV) myocardial stiffness. Little is known about the relation of OPG and LV structure and function in African-Americans who are disproportionately affected by HFpEF.
Clinical evidence suggests that symptoms in premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) reflect abnormal responsivity to ovarian steroids. This differential steroid sensitivity could be underpinned by abnormal processing of the steroid signal. We used a pharmacometabolomics approach in women with prospectively confirmed PMDD (n=15) and controls without menstrual cycle-related affective symptoms (n=15). All were medication-free with normal menstrual cycle lengths. Notably, women with PMDD were required to show hormone sensitivity in an ovarian suppression protocol. Ovarian suppression was induced for 6 months with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-agonist (Lupron); after 3 months all were randomized to 4 weeks of estradiol (E2) or progesterone (P4). After a 2-week washout, a crossover was performed. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry measured 49 steroid metabolites in serum. Values were excluded if >40% were below the limit of detectability (n=21). Analyses were performed with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests using false-discovery rate (q<0.2) for multiple comparisons. PMDD and controls had similar basal levels of metabolites during Lupron and P4-derived neurosteroids during Lupron or E2/P4 conditions. Both groups had significant increases in several steroid metabolites compared with the Lupron alone condition after treatment with E2 (that is, estrone-SO4 (q=0.039 and q=0.002, respectively) and estradiol-3-SO4 (q=0.166 and q=0.001, respectively)) and after treatment with P4 (that is, allopregnanolone (q=0.001 for both PMDD and controls), pregnanediol (q=0.077 and q=0.030, respectively) and cortexone (q=0.118 and q=0.157, respectively). Only sulfated steroid metabolites showed significant diagnosis-related differences. During Lupron plus E2 treatment, women with PMDD had a significantly attenuated increase in E2-3-sulfate (q=0.035) compared with control women, and during Lupron plus P4 treatment a decrease in DHEA-sulfate (q=0.07) compared with an increase in controls. Significant effects of E2 addback compared with Lupron were observed in women with PMDD who had significant decreases in DHEA-sulfate (q=0.065) and pregnenolone sulfate (q=0.076), whereas controls had nonsignificant increases (however, these differences did not meet statistical significance for a between diagnosis effect). Alterations of sulfotransferase activity could contribute to the differential steroid sensitivity in PMDD. Importantly, no differences in the formation of P4-derived neurosteroids were observed in this otherwise highly selected sample of women studied under controlled hormone exposures.
Aim To analyse the long-term impact of altered metabolism on the level of mediators of inflammatory response in female patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods This study included 97 female patients with type 2 diabetes and 107 female, nondiabetic control subjects, who were recruited at the Clinical Centre University of Sarajevo and the General Hospital Te�anj. The effects of glycaemic control on markers of inflammatory response represented by C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, leukocytes, sedimentation rate, and cytokine IL-6 were tested. All subjects were free of evidence of infections, surgery, thyroid disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, active liver and kidney damage. All biochemical analyses were performed according to standard International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) protocols. Results A significant increase of fibrinogen (p<0.001), CRP (p=0.001), interleukin-6 (p=0.013), leukocytes (p<0.001) and sedimentation rate (p=0.008) in diabetic female population compared to control subjects was found. A significant correlation between CRP and haemoglobin A1c (p=0.035), interleukin-6 and glucose (p=0.032), IL-6 and body mass index (p=0.007) was found. Conclusion Our data suggest that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes in female diabetic population. A more detailed study on a far larger number of subjects is needed if they were to be used effectively as biomarkers in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes in this population.
Aim To investigate total homocysteine (tHcy) serum concentration in patients with probable vascular dementia (VD) and in agematched controls, as well as to determine an association between tHcy serum concentration and cognitive impairment in patients with probable VD. Methods Serum concentration of tHcy was determined by the Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay on the AxSYM System. Cognitive impairment was tested by the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each subject included in the study. Results Age, systolic, diastolic blood pressure and BMI did not differ significantly between the two groups. Mean serum tHcy concentration in the control group of subjects was 13.35 �mol/L, while in patients with probable VD it was significantly higher, 19.45 �mol/L (p=0.002). A negative but insignificant association between serum tHcy concentration and cognitive impairment in patients with probable VD was found. Conclusion Increased tHcy concentration in patients with probable VD suggests the possible independent role of Hcy in the pathogenesis of VD.
The metabolic and physiologic responses to exercise are increasingly interesting, given that regular physical activity enhances antioxidant capacity, improves cardiac function, and protects against type 2 diabetes. The metabolic interactions between tissues and the heart illustrate a critical cross-talk we know little about.
The pressure study was carried out to evaluate the hypotheses that ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) is superior to clinic blood pressure for ischemic stroke and that ABP is important to refine risk stratification.
A cohort of household contacts of tuberculosis (TB) index cases from four public health clinics in S�o Paulo, Brazil.
A variant within the gene locus encoding PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22) emerged as an important risk factor for auto-inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes, but at the same time protects from Crohn disease, one of the 2 main forms of inflammatory bowel diseases. We have previously shown that loss of PTPN22 results in decreased NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) activation and that this effect is mediated via enhanced NLRP3 phosphorylation. However, it is unclear how phosphorylation of NLRP3 mediates its inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that loss of macroautophagy/autophagy abrogates the inhibitory effect on NLRP3 activation observed upon loss of PTPN22. Phosphorylated, but not nonphosphorylated NLRP3 is found in autophagosomes, indicating that NLRP3 phosphorylation mediates its inactivation via promoting sequestration into phagophores, the precursors to autophagosomes. This finding shows that autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are connected, and that PTPN22 plays a key role in the regulation of those 2 pathways. Given its role in inflammatory disorders, PTPN22 might be an attractive therapeutic target, and understanding the cellular mechanisms modulated by PTPN22 is of crucial importance.
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) causes blindness in the working age for people with diabetes in most countries. The increasing number of people with diabetes worldwide suggests that DR will continue to be major contributors to vision loss. Early detection of retinopathy progress in individuals with diabetes is critical for preventing visual loss. Non-proliferative DR (NPDR) is an early stage of DR. Moreover, NPDR can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. This paper proposes a novel morphology-based algorithm for detecting retinal lesions and classifying each case. First, the proposed algorithm detects the three DR lesions, namely haemorrhages, microaneurysms and exudates. Second, we defined and extracted a set of features from detected lesions. The set of selected feature emulates what physicians looked for in classifying NPDR case. Finally, we designed an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier with three layers to classify NPDR to normal, mild, moderate and severe. Bayesian regularisation and resilient backpropagation algorithms are used to train ANN. The accuracy for the proposed classifiers based on Bayesian regularisation and resilient backpropagation algorithms are 96.6 and 89.9, respectively. The obtained results are compared with results of the recent published classifier. Our proposed classifier outperforms the best in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
Effective motivational support is needed in chronic disease management. This study was undertaken to improve a novel type 2 diabetes motivational intervention, (functional imagery training, FIT) based on participant feedback and results from a self-management randomised controlled trial.
Most of type 2 diabetes is thought to be the result of interaction between genetic and environmental factors. However, the genetic components discovered to date can explain only a small proportion of the observed heritability. The "missing heritability" may be accounted for by rare variants, gene-environment interactions, and epigenetics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
A growing body of evidence has shown that type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risks of total cancer death and total cancer incidence including cancers of the liver, endometrium, pancreas, kidney, colorectum, bladder, and breast (1) . Of interest, the risk of prostate cancer is significantly decreased. Although the majority of the studies on this topic have been conducted in Western countries, those risk ratios (RRs) of all-cancer mortality and incidence across all cancer types are reportedly even higher in Asians (Table 1) (2) . Type 2 diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia secondary to insulin resistance, and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue in development for type 2 diabetes (T2D). This trial assessed the safety and efficacy of monotherapy with once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide versus sitagliptin in Japanese subjects with T2D.
Diabetes is well-established to be a major healthcare problem. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that diabetes influences the heart and may be associated with cardiac repolarisation abnormalities and pro-arrhythmia. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The discovery of the specific bile acid receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) in enteroendocrine L cells has prompted research focusing on the impact of bile acids on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and glucose metabolism. The aim of the present study was to assess the GLP-1 secretory and gluco-metabolic effects of endogenously released bile, with and without concomitant administration of the bile acid-sequestering resin, sevelamer, in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major health concern that seems to be influenced by seasonality.
The purpose of developing mobile applications for diabetes is generally to: (1) provide enhanced access to timely information for patients, health care professionals, and researchers; (2) facilitate remote monitoring and diagnosis of patients, often based on information delivered by wearable devices; (3) provide decision support to assist patients in selecting treatment; or (4) deliver timely recommendations for treatment to increase adherence to prescribed therapy. There is a perception that mobile applications can provide meaningful clinical benefits, however, there is only sparse convincing evidence to support this belief at the present time. Compounding this problem is the short life span of digital software, such that if a traditional type of randomized controlled trial is conducted on a product, by the time the study has been designed, approved by an IRB, conducted, and analyzed, the product might have significantly changed to a next generation system. Because of great interest in establishing what are the potential benefits, metrics of success, and appropriate components of mobile applications for diabetes, Diabetes Technology Society and William Sansum Diabetes Center launched the Digital Diabetes Congress, March 7-8, 2017, in San Francisco. This report contains summaries of the meeting's 12 sessions. Each summary was written by the session's moderator who helped develop the session prior to the event and keep it on track during the event. This meeting report presents a summary of how 57 panelists, speakers, and moderators, who are leaders in digital health, see the current and future landscape of digital health tools applied to diabetes.
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was reported to increase the risk of dementia(s) even more than stroke. We assessed the prevalence of PAD in a group with definite diagnosis of dementia.
Patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) suffer from inflammatory diseases often treated by large amounts of corticosteroids. Whether this inflammatory burden also carries an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity, and especially ischemic heart disease, is not clearly established.
Preclinical Research Mimetics of Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) represent a useful alternative or complementary treatment choice to insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The lack of hypoglycemia as a side effect when GLP-1 receptor agonists are used along with the tendency of these therapeutic agents to prevent or even reduce weight gain makes them valuable targets in therapy development. However, native GLP-1 and many of its early analogues have very short half-lives, requiring repeated treatment to maintain therapeutic levels. As all current treatments are injected subcutaneously, a large focus has been made on trying to extend the half-lives of GLP-1 analogues while retaining bioactivity. Most success in this regard has been achieved with the use of peptide-protein fusions, which are not as well suited for oral administration. However, recent work focused on the development of non-fusion peptides with increased half-lives that may be more appropriate for oral administration. This minireview discusses the structural characteristics of past and present analogues as well as the recent work conducted toward developing novel GLP-1 receptor agonists.

In order to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and type 2 diabetic erectile dysfunction (T2DED), we analyzed the characteristics of gut microbiota in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with T2DED. Thirty-five SD rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group (n=15) with normal diet, and experimental group (n=20) with construction of T2D model. Faecal and serum samples were collected at 2nd and 8th week after establishment of T2D model, respectively. Faecal samples were used for analysis of gut microbiota, and serum samples for detection of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and inflammatory factors like interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-10, and monocyte chemoattractantprotein-1 (MCP-1). The main compositions of gut microbiota were Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes at the phylum level, and Oscillospira, Allobaculum, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, SMB53, Prevotella, Coprococcus, Sutterella and Blautia at the genus level with relatively higher abundance in all SD rats. The relative abundance of Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Aerococcus, Facklamia (opportunistic pathogens in most case) increased, and that of Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Anaerotruncus (beneficial bacteria) decreased in T2DED group as compared with that at 2nd week after establishment of T2D model (T2D2 group). The serum contents of TMAO, LPS, IL-1, IL-2, IL-10 and MCP-1 in T2DED group were significantly higher than those in control group. The gut microbiota of T2DED rats was inhibited. The gut microbiota of T2DED rats had changed, as the relative abundance of beneficial bacterium was decreased while that of opportunistic pathogens was increased. The variations of gut microbiota might lead to inflammation and prompt the emergence of erectile dysfunction in the rats with T2D. TMAO might play an important role in the formation of T2DED.
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of only Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and body mass index (BMI) of 30-40�kg/m(2). A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL. The searches were performed in February 2017. English was the target language of the publications. The PICO question was used to determine eligibility for studies to be included: population, patient with BMI 30-40�kg/m2; intervention, RYGB; comparison, control group with medical care alone; and outcome, metabolic outcomes. Only randomized clinical trials (RCT) were selected. The main outcome was T2D remission. Secondary outcomes were metabolic effect of RYGB, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. A total of five RCTs were included. The studies included a larger proportion of women, and the average time of T2D duration ranged between 6 and 10�years with 43.3% of the patients having a BMI below 35�kg/m(2). Despite randomization, the baseline demographics such as age, HbA1c, and duration of diabetes were often less favorable in the surgical group. At the longest follow-up, RYGB significantly improves total and partial type 2 remission, OR 17.48 (95% CI 4.28-71.35) and OR 20.71 (95% CI 5.16-83.12), respectively. HbA1c also reduces at longest follow-up in the surgery group (-�1.83 (95% CI -�2.14; -�1.51)). All these three outcomes revealed high level of evidence according to GRADE evaluation. There is already strong evidence that RYGB improves metabolic outcomes for at least 5�years in patients with class I obesity.
Reticulated platelets (RPs) are immature platelets with high dense granules content and a residual amount of megakaryocyte-derived of mRNA. Increased level of RPs has been found to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular ischemic events, and has been associated with impaired response to various anti-platelet drugs. The study aimed to characterize and compare the surface antigenic properties of reticulated versus mature platelets. Platelets from healthy individuals and diabetic patients were tested at rest and after activation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP). For each patient, we calculated the proportion of RPs and mature platelets using flow cytometry analysis with thiazole orange staining (for RPs) and CD42b platelet-specific antibody. We also tested the surface expression of P-selectin and Annexin V, by double staining flow cytometry in RPs versus mature platelets. A total of 20 subjects were recruited (10 healthy individuals, 10 diabetics). Activation with ADP did not cause a significant change in the proportion of RPs. Following activation, RPs demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of both P-selectin and Annexin V, while mature platelets exhibited a non-significant increase in both markers. These findings were consistent in both healthy subjects and patients with diabetes. In conclusion, RPs have a significantly higher capacity to increase the expression of platelet activation markers compared with mature platelets.
The risk factors for post-procedural events after carotid artery stenting (CAS) have not been well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of post-CAS complications. A total of 358 consecutive patients who underwent CAS were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients' demographic data, clinical characteristics, and complications after CAS within 30�days were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify possible risk factors for post-procedural complications after CAS. The incidence of complications after CAS within 30�days was 7.0%. Logistic regression analysis identified the following as independent risk factors for 30-day transient ischemic attacks, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death after CAS: metabolic syndrome (OR�=�2.31, 95% CI 1.91-3.01, P�=�0.004), diabetes (OR�=�2.24, 95% CI 1.74-2.76, P�=�0.026), symptomatic patient (OR�=�1.73, 95% CI 1.23-3.05, P�=�0.011), and age (OR�=�1.87, 95% CI 1.35-2.57, P�=�0.042). Among the components of MetS, central obesity (OR�=�2.21, 95% CI 1.24-2.63, P�=�0.006), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (OR�=�1.66, 95% CI 1.34-2.27, P�=�0.022), and high fasting plasma glucose (OR�=�2.32, 95% CI 1.85-2.74, P�=�0.003) were associated with increased risk of 30-day complications after CAS. This present study suggests that patients with metabolic syndrome have significantly increased risk of complications after CAS within 30�days. Moreover, MetS patients with central obesity, high fasting plasma glucose, or low HDL-C have significantly increased risk of complications after CAS within 30�days.
This study aimed to evaluate the association of socioeconomic status and comorbidities with uncomplicated and complicated diverticular disease (DD) in Sweden.
Bitter melon (Momordica charantia, MC) has been used in traditional Korean medicine in treating diabetes. In addition, some reports were emerged, showing the antifertility activities of MC in mammals. We investigated the effects of ethanolic MC extract on the reproductive activity of golden hamsters whose spermatogenetic capacity is controlled by their photoperiods. The animals were divided into 4 groups: long photoperiod (LP) control, short photoperiod (SP) control, and LP animals treated with MC. The animals were orally ingested with low (0.03 g/kg) or high (0.15 g/kg) concentrations of the ethanolic extracts for 8 weeks on the daily basis. The control animals received the vehicle. The animals were then mated with age-matched females, experienced pregnancy. As results, the LP control animals showed active large testes but SP control animals displayed remarkably reduced testes. The animals treated with both concentrations of MC extracts demonstrated large testes, indicating fertile activity as animals in LP. LP control animals had litters as expected, but SP controls had no litters at all. MC extract showed the same results as LP animals in generating offsprings. These results suggest that the MC extract does not change the photoperiodic influence on reproductive activity of male golden hamsters.

Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade. This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and also for chronic kidney disease. A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset chronic kidney disease. In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight. The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the long-term. The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased 10-fold in recent years. Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer. This year, the World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that make preventive behaviors an affordable option.
Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts for 40-50% of patients requiring renal replacement therapy. The main pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy comprises glucose-dependent pathways, hemodynamic pathways, and genetic factors.
Hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia are the most frequent and diagnosed chronic diseases in Argentina. They contribute largely to the burden of chronic disease and they are strongly influenced by a small number of risk factors. These risk factors are all modifiable at the population and individual level and offer major prospects for their prevention. We are interested in socioeconomic determinants of prevalence of those 3 specific diseases.
Production of scientific data has been accelerated exponentially though ease of access to the required knowledge is still challenging. Hence, the emergence of new frameworks to allow more efficient storage of information would be beneficial. Attaining intelligent platforms enable the smart article to serve as a forum for exchanging idea among experts of academic disciplines for a rapid and efficient scientific discourse.
Diabetes and heart failure are closely related: patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing heart failure and those with heart failure are at higher risk of developing diabetes. Furthermore, antidiabetic medications increase the risk of mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with and without pre-existing heart failure. When the two diseases are considered individually, heart failure has a much poorer prognosis than diabetes mellitus; therefore heart failure has to be a priority for treatment in patients presenting with the two conditions, and the diabetic patient with heart failure should be managed by the heart failure team. No specific randomised clinical trials have been conducted to test the effect of cardiovascular drugs in diabetic patients with heart failure, but a wealth of evidence suggests that all interventions effective at improving prognosis in patients with heart failure are equally beneficial in patients with and without diabetes. The negative effect of glucose-lowering agents in patients with heart failure or at increased risk of heart failure has become evident after the withdrawal of rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, from the EU market due to evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular events and hospitalisations for heart failure. An important issue that remains unresolved is the optimal target level of glycated haemoglobin, as recent studies have demonstrated significant reductions in total mortality, morbidity and risk of heart failure despite achieving HbA1c levels similar to those observed in the UKPDS study conducted some decades ago. Meta-analyses showed that intensive glucose lowering is not associated with any significant reduction in cardiovascular risk but conversely results in a significant increase in heart failure risk. Different medications have different risk: benefit ratios in diabetic patients with heart failure; therefore, the heart failure team must judge the required intensity of glycaemic control, the type and dose of glucose lowering agents and any change in glucose-lowering therapy, according to the clinical conditions present.
Frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) is increasingly available for the improvement of the success rate of assisted reproductive technologies other than fresh embryo transfer (ET). There have been numerous findings that FET provides better obstetric and perinatal outcomes. However, the birth weight of infants conceived using FET is heavier than that of those conceived via ET. In addition, some reports have suggested that FET is associated with perinatal diseases such as placenta accreta and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH).
Nocardiosis is caused by an aerobic actinomycete, most commonly introduced through the respiratory tract. The Nocardiae are gram-positive, partially acid-fast bacteria. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis infections are rare and caused by the traumatic introduction of organisms percutaneously. The manifestation is usually an opportunistic infection. Cutaneous involvement may develop as one of four types: mycetoma, lymphocutaneous infection, superficial skin infection, or systemic disease with cutaneous involvement. Diagnosis and evaluation of appropriate specimens are principally by culture.
Inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) have immediate glucose-lowering effects by promoting urinary glucose excretion, without altering insulin level. Only a few studies have evaluated blood glucose dynamics in the early period after administration. The present retrospective study was designed to determine the immediate effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on blood glucose dynamics.
Activating transcription factor-5 (ATF5) is an anti-apoptotic factor and has been implicated in enhancing the survival of cancer cells under stress and in regulating the autophagy process. Targeting ATF5 in anticancer therapy may be particularly attractive because of its differential role in cancer cells than in non-transformed cells, thus allowing specificity of the treatment. Using the delivery of short hairpin RNA vectors into the Mvt1 and Met1 cell lines, we tested the role of ATF5 in the development of mammary tumors in vivo and in regulating proliferation and migration of these cells in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that knockdown of ATF5 (ATF5-KD) in both cell lines results in a decreased tumor volume and weight, as well as in a reduced proliferation rate and migratory potential of the cells. In addition, ATF5-KD led to an increased autophagy flux and a shift in the sub-populations comprising Mvt1 cells from the aggressive CD24-positive cells toward less aggressive CD24-negative cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that ATF5 plays an important role in enhancing mammary tumor cells overall aggressiveness and in promoting mammary tumor growth and emphasize the possible benefit of anti-ATF5 therapy in breast cancer patients, particularly, against tumors characterized with the positive expression of cell surface CD24.
Aims and Objectives: The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in homeostasis and organismic recreation, control of immune function, inflammation, and bone growth. It also regulates blood pressure and orthostasis via vagal and sympathetic pathways. Besides recording of heart rate variability (HRV), which characterizes medium (1-5 min) and long term (circadian) autonomic tone or modulation, no gentle tests of short-term autonomic reactivity and control are available. In 1976 Nogier described a short time cardiovascular response ("R�flexe Auriculo Cardiaque", RAC) which could be used to investigate short term autonomic reactions without changing system characteristics and thus being repeatable in short intervals. In this paper, we investigated the possible application of the Nogier reaction as a micro-test for the identification of a disturbed sensitivity or reactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Methods: We statistically analyzed cardiovascular signals derived during the application of small repeated stimuli utilizing methods of signal averaging to characterize the physiological background. Specifically, the Nogier reaction was investigated using simultaneous recordings of ECG, pulse waves, and respiration. Results: Significant fast (delay 1-5 s) and slower (delay 6-12 s) cardio-autonomic responses to different stimuli which characterize short term were observed. From time characteristics and type of signals where they occur we deduce that fast changes observed in heart rate are vagal reactions to the small stimuli whereas slower changes observed in pulse waves stem from sympathetic nervous system responses. Conclusions: The investigated autonomic micro-test opens the possibility to differentially investigate both limbs of the autonomic nervous system with minimal stimuli. It can be performed within seconds and does not change the set point of the system in opposition to less subtle tests such as Valsalva maneuver. Therefore, it is well-suited for quick, repeated measurements of autonomic nervous system reactivity.
To determine the possibility that diabetes mellitus promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via glyceraldehyde (GA)-derived advanced glycation-end products (GA-AGEs).
Islet transplantation has been clinically proven to be effective at treating type 1 diabetes. However, the current intrahepatic transplantation strategy may incur acute whole blood reactions and result in poor islet engraftment. Here, we report a robust protocol for the transplantation of islets at the extrahepatic transplantation site-the epididymal fat pad (EFP)-in a diabetic mouse model. A protocol to isolate and purify islets at high yields from C57BL/6J mice is described, as well as a transplantation method performed by seeding islets onto a decellularized scaffold (DCS) and implanting them at the EFP site in syngeneic C57BL/6J mice rendered diabetic by streptozotocin. The DCS graft containing 500 islets reversed the hyperglycemic condition within 10 days, while the free islets without DCS required at least 30 days. The normoglycemia was maintained for up to 3 months until the graft was explanted. In conclusion, DCS enhanced the engraftment of islets into the extrahepatic site of the EFP, which could easily be retrieved and might provide a reproducible and useful platform for investigating the scaffold materials, as well as other transplantation parameters required for a successful islet engraftment.
68-year-old female patient with no significant medical history presents with a 3-month history of progressive neurological symptoms, which began with left eye ptosis, blurred vision and non-painful jaw discomfort, followed by left spastic weakness and hyper-reflexia with positive Babinski and Hoffman signs. An elevated T3 level, a positive peroxidase and an antigraves antibody level led to an ultrasound, which confirmed a sub acute-chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. A nerve conduction studies/electromyogram showed normal motor and sensory velocity conduction with a small amplitude compound motor action potential, indicative of likely axonal damage. Following treatment with carbimazole, the neurological symptoms greatly improved. The authors concluded that the left pyramidal syndrome was secondary to autoimmune free T3-thyrotoxicosis.
We analyzed trends in rates of health insurance coverage in China in the period 1991-2011 and the association of health insurance with hypertension and diabetes based on data from eight waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The rate of coverage fell from 32.3�percent in 1991 to 21.9�percent in 2000, rebounding to 49.7�percent in 2006 and then rapidly climbing to 94.7�percent in 2011. Our study indicated that neither the prevalence of diabetes nor that of hypertension was significantly associated with health insurance coverage. When patients were aware of their condition or disease, those with insurance had a significantly higher likelihood of treatment for diabetes and hypertension, compared to those without insurance. We observed an association between health insurance coverage and seeking preventive care and receiving medical treatment when patients were aware of their condition or disease.
Appalachia-a region that stretches from Mississippi to New York-has historically been recognized as a socially and economically disadvantaged part of the United States, and growing evidence suggests that health disparities between it and the rest of the country are widening. We compared infant mortality and life expectancy disparities in Appalachia to those outside the region during the period 1990-2013. We found that infant mortality disparities widened for both whites and blacks, with infant mortality 16�percent higher in Appalachia in 2009-13, and the region's deficit in life expectancy increased from 0.6 years in 1990-92 to 2.4 years in 2009-13. The association between area poverty and life expectancy was stronger in Appalachia than in the rest of the United States. We found wide health disparities, including a thirteen-year gap in life expectancy among black men in high-poverty areas of Appalachia, compared to white women in low-poverty areas elsewhere. Higher mortality in Appalachia from cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, nephritis or kidney diseases, suicide, unintentional injuries, and drug overdose contributed to lower life expectancy in the region, compared to the rest of the country. Widening health disparities were also due to slower mortality improvements in Appalachia.
The mechanisms and relevance of impaired glucose homeostasis in advanced heart failure (HF) are poorly understood. The study goals were to examine glucose regulation, pancreatic endocrine function, and metabolic factors related to prognosis in patients with nondiabetic advanced HF.
Hypertension represents a major cardiovascular risk factor. The pathophysiology of increased blood pressure (BP) is not yet completely understood. Transcriptome profiling offers possibilities to uncover genetics effects on BP. Based on 2 populations including 2549 individuals, a meta-analyses of monocytic transcriptome-wide profiles were performed to identify transcripts associated with BP. Replication was performed in 2 independent studies of whole-blood transcriptome data including 1990 individuals. For identified candidate genes, a direct link between long-term changes in BP and gene expression over time and by treatment with BP-lowering therapy was assessed. The predictive value of protein levels encoded by candidate genes for subsequent cardiovascular disease was investigated. Eight transcripts (CRIP1, MYADM, TIPARP, TSC22D3, CEBPA, F12, LMNA, and TPPP3) were identified jointly accounting for up to 13% (95% confidence interval, 8.7-16.2) of BP variability. Changes in CRIP1, MYADM, TIPARP, LMNA, TSC22D3, CEBPA, and TPPP3 expression associated with BP changes-among these, CRIP1 gene expression was additionally correlated to measures of cardiac hypertrophy. Assessment of circulating CRIP1 (cystein-rich protein 1) levels as biomarkers showed a strong association with increased risk for incident stroke (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.09; P=5.0�10(-5)). Our comprehensive analysis of global gene expression highlights 8 novel transcripts significantly associated with BP, providing a link between gene expression and BP. Translational approaches further established evidence for the potential use of CRIP1 as emerging disease-related biomarker.
In adults with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH), in particular those with insulinoma, the optimal diagnostic and management strategies remain uncertain. Here, we sought to characterise the biochemical and radiological assessment, and clinical management of adults with HH at a tertiary centre over a thirteen-year period.
Evaluation of predictors of silent coronary artery disease (SCAD) in high-risk asymptomatic diabetic patients and to evaluate their two-year outcome.
Data obtained from registries have shown that women diagnosed with STEMI are older, have more co-morbidities and a worse clinical outcome than men. Aim of this study was to investigate potential gender differences in in-hospital and long-term mortality in patients from Vienna STEMI registry (2003-2009).
Despite its superior efficacy, clozapine is an underutilized agent, primarily owing to the "Clozaphobia"-fear of clozapine's adverse effects. Emergent cautions on metabolic side-effects have contributed to avoidance of clozapine prescription. Here, we describe our clinical experience with nine patients having schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorders with comorbid diabetes mellitus and treated with clozapine. Interestingly, all patients could be maintained on optimal glycemic control even after clozapine. In conclusion, a critique on the potential risks versus benefits of clozapine amidst our observations from this case series adds further supporting evidence to the emerging literature on the clinical utility of clozapine in treating schizophrenia patients with diabetes mellitus.
Acquired dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors of patients with schizophrenia may affect their life expectancy, disease complications and prognosis. The objectives of the current study were to assess the dietary habits and other lifestyle behaviors for Bahraini patients with schizophrenia, and to determine their associations with different medical comorbidities.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often coexist. The mechanistic links between these two diseases are complex, multifactorial, and not entirely understood, but they can influence the approach to treatment. Understanding whether COPD comes first followed by T2DM or vice versa, or whether the two diseases develop simultaneously due to common underlying mechanisms, is important for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to these two important diseases. In this review, we discuss the potential links between COPD and T2DM and pharmacological approaches that might target these links.
Early neurological worsening is associated with increased mortality and long-term functional disability. We developed the WORSEN score for predicting whether patients with stroke will deteriorate during the week after stroke onset and investigated its usefulness.
Diabetes mellitus is a specific risk factor for intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) regardless of race. However, it is largely unknown whether poor glycemic control is associated with the severity of ICAS in diabetic patients.
Although studies demonstrate techniques to limit hypoglycaemia in critically ill patients, there are limited data supporting methods to improve management of existing hypoglycaemia.
Shared decision-making (SDM) is a patient-centred approach in which clinicians and patients work side-by-side to decide together on the best course of action for each patient's particular situation. Six key elements of SDM can be distinguished: situation diagnosis, choice awareness, option clarification, discussion of harms and benefits, deliberation of patient preferences and making the decision. Decision aids (DAs) are tools that facilitate SDM. The impact of DAs for chronic illnesses on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes remains uncertain.
Research published to date on the relationship between insulin resistance (IR) and fructose consumption is scarce, has used different methods, and has yielded sometimes contradictory results. This study aims to determine whether a low-fructose and/or low-sucrose diet supervised by a physician or nurse decreases IR compared to a standard diet.
This study compares a combination of processes of care and clinical targets among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) between specialist diabetes clinics (SDCs) and general medical clinics (GMCs), and how differences between these two types of clinics differ with hospital type (community, provincial and regional).
Although the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 (APS-3) is the commonest APS that may be encountered in pediatric age, last year literature includes only few studies aiming to specifically ascertain the clinical spectrum of APS-3 in childhood and adolescence. Aims of these study were: a) to ascertain how many young patients with apparently isolated Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) are at risk of manifesting other autoimmune disorders (ADs) compatible with APS-3; b) to individuate the ADs which most frequently segregate with HT in the context of an APS-3.
This open-label, parallel-group study evaluated the effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of luseogliflozin in Japanese subjects. Thirteen subjects with hepatic impairment (mild, n = 8; moderate, n = 5) and 6 healthy subjects received a single 5-mg dose of luseogliflozin. Serial blood sampling over 72 hours and 24-hour urine collection were done for pharmacokinetic analysis of luseogliflozin and its metabolites and to measure pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, respectively. Demographic characteristics were similar at baseline for both groups. Geometric mean ratios of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf [90%CI]) of unchanged luseogliflozin were 1.02 (0.790-1.32) and 0.774 (0.580-1.03), respectively, on comparing patients with hepatic impairment with healthy subjects, and 0.939 (0.752-1.17) and 1.00 (0.780-1.28), respectively, in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. Although mean plasma concentrations of metabolites were slightly higher in patients with hepatic impairment versus healthy subjects, their time-course plasma concentrations were very low compared with those of unchanged luseogliflozin. Single-dose luseogliflozin 5 mg was well tolerated by study participants, indicating luseogliflozin dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment.
C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is an alpha-chemokine receptor specific for stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 also called CXCL12). The antagonist of CXCR4 can mobilize CD34+ cells and hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow within several hours, and it has an efficacy on diabetes ulcer through acting on the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. In this study, we investigated for the first time whether the antagonist of CXCR4 (Plerixafor/AMD3100) delivered on acellular dermal matrix (ADM) may accelerate diabetes-impaired wound healing. ADM scaffolds were fabricated from nondiabetic mouse skin through decellularization processing and incorporated with AMD3100 to construct ADM-AMD3100 scaffold. Full-thickness cutaneous wound in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were treated with ADM, AMD3100, or ADM-AMD3100. 21 days after treatment, wound closure in ADM-AMD3100-treated mice was more complete than ADM group and AMD3100 group, and it was accompanied by thicker collagen formation. Correspondingly, diabetic mice treated with ADM-AMD3100 demonstrated prominent neovascularization (higher capillary density and vascular smooth muscle actin), which were accompanied by up-regulated mRNA levels of SDF-1 and enhanced migration of CXCR4 in the granulation tissue. Our results demonstrate that ADM scaffold provide perfect niche for loading AMD3100 and ADM-AMD3100 is a promising method for diabetic wound healing mainly by increasing expression of SDF-1 and enhancing migration of CXCR4-positive cells.
Vascular risk factors have been associated with cognitive decline. Midlife exposure to these factors may be most important in conferring late-life risk of cognitive impairment.
Reemergence of previous stroke-related deficits (or poststroke recrudescence [PSR]) is an underrecognized and inadequately characterized phenomenon.
Inhibitory receptors (IRs) are pivotal in controlling T cell homeostasis because of their intrinsic regulation of conventional effector T (Tconv) cell proliferation, viability, and function. However, the role of IRs on regulatory T cells (Tregs) remains obscure because they could be required for suppressive activity and/or limit Treg function. We evaluated the role of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3; CD223) on Tregs by generating mice in which LAG3 is absent on the cell surface of Tregs in a murine model of type 1 diabetes. Unexpectedly, mice that lacked LAG3 expression on Tregs exhibited reduced autoimmune diabetes, consistent with enhanced Treg proliferation and function. Whereas the transcriptional landscape of peripheral wild-type (WT) and Lag3-deficient Tregs was largely comparable, substantial differences between intra-islet Tregs were evident and involved a subset of genes and pathways that promote Treg maintenance and function. Consistent with these observations, Lag3-deficient Tregs outcompeted WT Tregs in the islets but not in the periphery in cotransfer experiments because of enhanced interleukin-2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 signaling and increased Eos expression. Our study suggests that LAG3 intrinsically limits Treg proliferation and function at inflammatory sites, promotes autoimmunity in a chronic autoimmune-prone environment, and may contribute to Treg insufficiency in autoimmune disease.
NLRP3 and NLRP1 inflammasomes signaling pathways may play an important role in the development and progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, relative research is rare.
Quercetin, naringenin, and berberine are plant bioactives that can cross the blood-brain barrier and offer neuroprotection. In the present study, we looked into the effect of them on expression of various glucose transporters and key components of brain insulin signalling, namely, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1), phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K), Akt 1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in brain of control, diabetic and bioactive-treated rats by Western blot. Amongst the bioactives tested, quercetin was more potent and restored LRP1 and brain insulin signalling components as well as glucose transporters such as GLUTs 1, 2, 3 and 4 in diabetic animals. On the other hand, berberine and naringenin supplementation to diabetic animals improved brain IRS 1 levels and restored GLUT 1 and GLUT 3 expression without significant effect on PI3K and Akt 1 activation and GLUT 4 levels. From the present study, we conclude that quercetin, naringenin, and berberine can differentially act through insulin-dependent and -independent mechanisms thereby altering glucose homeostasis in the brain during experimental diabetes and bring about the beneficial effect.
This study describes the incidence and predictive factors for development of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and stroke, among subjects with IFG over a five-year period.
To evaluate circulating amino acids (AA) profiles in obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (MetS).
First, to conduct a detailed exploration of the prospective relations between four commonly used anthropometric measures with incident diabetes and to examine their consistency across different population subgroups. Second, to compare the ability of each of the measures to predict five-year risk of diabetes.
Screening for depression is recommended internationally. The World Health Organization's 5-item Well-being Index (WHO-5) is used clinically to screen for depression but its empirical suitability for this purpose is not well documented. We investigated the psychometric properties of the WHO-5 and its suitability for identifying likely depression in Australian adults with diabetes.
To describe diabetes treatment and hypoglycaemia in individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus during Ramadan.
There is no previous study comparing the predictive ability of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) versus a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in early pregnancy for large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants.
Epigenetic regulators, including microRNAs (miRNAs), are implicated in type 2 diabetes, but evidence linking circulating miRNAs in pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes (GDM) is sparse. Potential modifiers, including pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and offspring sex, are unexamined. We hypothesized that circulating levels of early-mid-pregnancy (range 7-23weeks of gestation) candidate miRNAs are related to subsequent development of GDM. We also hypothesized that miRNA-GDM associations might vary by pre-pregnancy body-mass index (ppBMI) or offspring sex.
Liver gas gangrene is a rare condition with a highly mortality rate. It is mostly associated with host factors, such as malignancy and immunosuppression.
To synthesize high-quality evidence to compare traditional in-person screening and tele-ophthalmology screening.
Little is known about medical morbidity among women Vietnam-era veterans, or the long-term physical health problems associated with their service. This study assessed agreement comparing data on physical health conditions from self-report and medical records from a population-based cohort of women Vietnam-era Veterans from the Health of Vietnam Era Women's Study (HealthViEWS).
Bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), is one of the most potent inducers of inflammatory signaling, yet it is abundant in the human gut and the modern diet. Small quantities of LPS routinely translocate from the gut lumen to the circulation (so-called metabolic endotoxaemia), and elevated plasma LPS concentrations are reported in a variety of chronic non-communicable diseases, including obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis and type II diabetes. Murine models of experimentally-induced endotoxaemia and Toll-like receptor-4 deficiency suggest that endotoxin may promote the metabolic disturbances that underpin these diseases. However, as bioactive LPS is cleared rapidly from the circulation, and reported levels of endotoxin in human plasma vary widely, the potential relevance of metabolic endotoxaemia to human disease remains unclear. We here review insight into these questions gained from human and murine models of experimental endotoxaemia, focusing on the kinetics of LPS neutralization and its clearance from blood, the limitations of the widely used limulus assay and alternative methods for LPS quantitation. We conclude that although new methods for LPS measurement will be required to definitively quantify the extent of metabolic endotoxaemia in man, evidence from numerous approaches suggests that this molecule may play a key role in the development of diverse metabolic diseases.
Sequence variants that affect mean fasting glucose levels do not necessarily affect risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). We assessed the effects of 36 reported glucose-associated sequence variants on between- and within-subject variance in fasting glucose levels in 69,142 Icelanders. The variant in TCF7L2 that increases fasting glucose levels increases between-subject variance (5.7% per allele, P = 4.2 � 10(-10)), whereas variants in GCK and G6PC2 that increase fasting glucose levels decrease between-subject variance (7.5% per allele, P = 4.9 � 10(-11) and 7.3% per allele, P = 7.5 � 10(-18), respectively). Variants that increase mean and between-subject variance in fasting glucose levels tend to increase T2D risk, whereas those that increase the mean but reduce variance do not (r(2) = 0.61). The variants that increase between-subject variance increase fasting glucose heritability estimates. Intuitively, our results show that increasing the mean and variance of glucose levels is more likely to cause pathologically high glucose levels than increase in the mean offset by a decrease in variance.
Human Milk (HM) is the best source for newborn nutrition until at least six months; it exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-infective functions, promotes immune system formation and supports organ development. Breastfeeding could also protect from obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, human colostrum (HC) presents a peculiar role in newborn support as a protective effect against allergic and chronic diseases, in addition to long-term metabolic benefits. In this review, we discuss the recent literature regarding "omics" technologies and growth factors (GF) in HC and the effects of pasteurization on its composition. Our aim was to provide new evidence in terms of transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, also in relation to maternal metabolic diseases and/or fetal anomalies and to underline the functions of GF. Since HC results are so precious, particularly for the vulnerable pre-terms category, we also discuss the importance of HM pasteurization to ensure donated HC even to neonates whose mothers are unable to provide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review analyzing in detail the molecular pattern, microbiota, bioactive factors, and dynamic profile of HC, finding clinical correlations of such mediators with their possible in vivo effects and with the consequent impact on neonatal outcomes.
The sharp increase of the aging population has raised the pressure on the current limited medical resources in China. To better allocate resources, a more accurate prediction on medical service demand is very urgently needed. This study aims to improve the prediction on medical services demand in China. To achieve this aim, the study combines Taylor Approximation into the Grey Markov Chain model, and develops a new model named Taylor-Markov Chain GM (1,1) (T-MCGM (1,1)). The new model has been tested by adopting the historical data, which includes the medical service on treatment of diabetes, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease from 1997 to 2015 in China. The model provides a predication on medical service demand of these three types of disease up to 2022. The results reveal an enormous growth of urban medical service demand in the future. The findings provide practical implications for the Health Administrative Department to allocate medical resources, and help hospitals to manage investments on medical facilities.
Thiazide diuretics are among the most widely used treatments for hypertension, but thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH), a clinically significant adverse effect, is poorly understood. Here, we have studied the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of patients hospitalized with TIH. In a cohort of 109 TIH patients, those with severe TIH displayed an extended phenotype of intravascular volume expansion, increased free water reabsorption, urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion, and reduced excretion of serum chloride, magnesium, zinc, and antidiuretic hormone. GWAS in a separate cohort of 48 TIH patients and 2,922 controls from the 1958 British birth cohort identified an additional 14 regions associated with TIH. We identified a suggestive association with a variant in SLCO2A1, which encodes a prostaglandin transporter in the distal nephron. Resequencing of SLCO2A1 revealed a nonsynonymous variant, rs34550074 (p.A396T), and association with this SNP was replicated in a second cohort of TIH cases. TIH patients with the p.A396T variant demonstrated increased urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and metabolites. Moreover, the SLCO2A1 phospho-mimic p.A396E showed loss of transporter function in vitro. These findings indicate that the phenotype of TIH involves a more extensive metabolic derangement than previously recognized. We propose one mechanism underlying TIH development in a subgroup of patients in which SLCO2A1 regulation is altered.
We describe the cardiovascular risk factors, clinical presentation, and prognosis in a comparative study of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) from the Cohorte des Patients ART�riopathes (COPART) cohort, which includes patients hospitalized for PAD in France. Among the 2514 patients included in the cohort, 189 had PAD before or at the age of 50 years and 2325 had it after. Young patients with PAD had diabetes less frequently (34% vs 46%, P < .001), were more frequent active smokers (58% vs 23%, P < 0.001), had lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; 41 � 14 vs 44 � 15 mg/dL, P = .026), and had a less frequent family and personal history of coronary heart disease. In a subset of 59 patients whose lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) was measured, the Lp(a) levels were higher in the young patients than in the older ones (89.7 mg/dL [9.7-151.3] vs 19.9 mg/dL [3.0-207.9], P = .004). Survival and amputation-free survival was 2.2 times higher (1.5-3.2, P < .001) in the young after 1 year. The onset of PAD before 50 years was associated with active smoking, low HDL-C, high Lp(a), and lower mortality.
Weight gain occurs commonly in young adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Following on a previous report that two self-regulation interventions reduced weight gain relative to control, this study examines whether these interventions also benefit CVD risk factors.
To investigate whether polycystic ovary syndrome further increases postpartum diabetes risk in women with gestational diabetes mellitus and to explore relationships between polycystic ovary syndrome and incident diabetes in women who do not develop gestational diabetes.
The focus of this edition of Clinical Pharmacolgoy & Therapeutics (CPT) is on drugs and renal function and will not include a detailed discussion of kidney disease and its treatment. It is well recognized that drugs affect the kidneys in different ways, while kidney disease impacts drug metabolism and response. It is impossible to underestimate the value of the kidneys to man in health and disease, from regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance to participating in drug metabolism and transport. Additionally, the kidneys serve as targets for drugs used to treat cardiovascular (CV) diseases including hypertension and heart failure, metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as playing a role in the regulation of several hormones. Kidney damage may be distinguished from changes in kidney function using biomarkers, as discussed in some detail in this issue.
Few people know of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), a rare disorder associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We aimed to describe phenotype and outcomes of AIP in patients with AIP.
Banxia-houpu decoction is a famous formula in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with the powerful anti-depressant activity.
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States. It is typically diagnosed in postmenopausal women. However, given the increasing incidence of risk factors such as obesity and diabetes in younger women, it is becoming a more prevalent problem in this age group. When endometrial cancer is diagnosed in patients of reproductive age, the standard surgical option of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may not be ideal for women interested in future fertility. Hence, conservative options for select patients should be discussed along with the associated outcomes of each approach. A number of studies have shown that in patients with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia and grade I endometrial carcinoma, a conservative approach is safe and feasible. The aim of this review is to summarize published evidence of fertility-sparing options such as hormonal therapy, hysteroscopic resection of focal lesions, and the role of intra-uterine devices. We will also provide the latest updates on ongoing prospective trials that explore strategies for conservative management in women with medical comorbidities or those interested in fertility preservation.
Our recent study has shown that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) administered to rabbits partially ameliorated several dexamethasone (dexP) effects on hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance and plasma lipid disorders. In the current investigation, we present the data on DHEA protective action against dexP-induced oxidative stress and albuminuria in rabbits. Four groups of adult male rabbits were used in the in vivo experiment: (1) control, (2) dexP-treated, (3) DHEA-treated and (4) both dexP- and DHEA-treated. Administration of dexP resulted in accelerated generation of renal hydroxyl free radicals (HFR) and malondialdehyde (MDA), accompanied by diminished superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and a dramatic rise in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. Treatment with DHEA markedly reduced dexP-induced oxidative stress in kidney-cortex due to a decline in NADPH oxidase activity and enhancement of catalase activity. Moreover, DHEA effectively attenuated dexP-evoked albuminuria. Surprisingly, dexP-treated rabbits exhibited elevation of GSH/GSSG ratio, accompanied by a decrease in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities as well as an increase in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity. Treatment with DHEA resulted in a decline in GSH/GSSG ratio and glutathione reductase (GR) activity, accompanied by an elevation of GPx activity. Interestingly, rabbits treated with both dexP and DHEA remained the control values of GSH/GSSG ratio. As the co-administration of DHEA with dexP resulted in (i) reduction of oxidative stress in kidney-cortex, (ii) attenuation of albuminuria and (iii) normalization of glutathione redox state, DHEA might limit several undesirable renal side effects during chronic GC treatment of patients suffering from allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Moreover, its supplementation might be particularly beneficial for the therapy of patients with glucocorticoid-induced diabetes.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been gaining major attention recently after the emergence of data showing the promising role of these proteins in lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis process, glucose and blood pressure regulation. PubMed, EMBASE, Scholar and Scopus databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials, observational studies, in-vitro trials and reviews about the role of PCSK9 in cardiovascular homeostasis. PCSK9 was found to have major impact on lipid homeostasis and inflammatory process through regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors. Furthermore, inflammation was found to stimulate the expression of PCSK9 in various cells. As for glomerular proteinuria, a positive correlation was determined between PCSK9 levels and the degree of proteinuria. Hypertension, a major cardiovascular risk factor, is likely affected by PCSK9 levels through their role on epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) surface expression. Likewise, some studies show that PCSK9 is associated with higher fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin, demonstrating a potential role of PCSK9 in glucose homeostasis. The role of PCSK9 in cardiovascular homeostasis is one that is still not completely unraveled. Studies have clearly shown the implication of PCSK9 in the cardiovascular risk factors: the higher the PCSK9 levels, the higher the risk of atherosclerosis, fasting plasma glucose and insulin resistance. Inhibiting PCSK9 may therefore theoretically prove to present great benefits in diabetic patients with high cardiovascular risk.
Hemodynamics during dynamic exercise is finely regulated by some neural mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is the metabolic part of the exercise pressor reflex, i.e. the muscle metaboreflex. Hemodynamic response during the metaboreflex is characterised by the recruitment of the reserves in cardiac inotropism, pre-load, after-load and chronotropism. If one of these reserves is exhausted, then the cardiovascular response is achieved by recruiting one of the other reserves, thereby indicating a remarkable plasticity of the control of circulation. In this review, the effects of a number of cardiovascular diseases - such as heart failure, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and metabolic syndrome - on hemodynamics during the metaboreflex are reviewed.
Cardiometabolic risk (CMR) is a cluster of risk factors that may predict the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. This study investigated the association between CMR with body mass index (BMI) among obese adults. The CMRs, including waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level, were quantified in 82 obese adults. The findings indicate the highest correlation coefficient value ( r) was .618 between BMI and waist circumference; a weak correlation between mass index and systolic ( r = .276) and diastolic ( r = .311) blood pressure and hs-CRP ( r = .384); and a very weak correlation between BMI level and fasting blood glucose ( r = .069), total cholesterol ( r = .014), low-density lipoprotein (.013), high-density lipoprotein (-.154), and triglyceride (.173). Future strategies for CMR reduction among obese adults should focus on waist circumference and hs-CRP level.
Diabetes is a long-standing disease that leads to secondary complications of capillaries such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Emerging evidence suggests that diabetes may also affect the cerebromicrovasculature, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and lead to changes in the brain that affect cognition and mood. Therefore, it is important to identify natural compounds that may have therapeutic benefit for reducing BBB dysfunction and improve patient quality of life. Preclinical evidence suggests that sesamol, a natural antioxidant in sesame seed oil, could have therapeutic benefit for treating BBB dysfunction during diabetes. Similarly, paroxetine, which shares a methylenedioxy moiety with sesamol shows clinical benefit for treating neuropathic pain associated with diabetes. This review emphasizes BBB dysfunction as a treatable secondary complication associated with diabetes and examines the evidence for the use of natural compounds like sesamol or existing therapies like paroxetine to help restore BBB function.
Dermatoglyphic studies, particularly those arising from the Dutch Hunger Winter Families Cohort, indicate an involvement of prenatal epigenetic insults in type-2 diabetes. However, the exact orchestration of this association is not fully understood. Herein is described a meta-analysis performed based on a belief that such an approach could shed some light as to the role of genetic & epigenetic influences in the etiology of type-2 diabetes.
Before adopting modern corn-and-grain-based western processed diets, circumpolar people had a high fat and protein subsistence diet and exhibited a low incidence of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Some health benefits are attributable to a subsistence diet that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. Pollution, both global and local, is a threat to wild foods, as it introduces contaminants into the food system. Northern indigenous people and their sled dogs are exposed to a variety of contaminants, including mercury, that accumulate in the fish and game that they consume. The sled dogs in Alaskan villages are maintained on the same subsistence foods as their human counterparts, primarily salmon, and therefore they can be used as a food systems model for researching the impact of changes in dietary components. In this study, the antioxidant status and mercury levels were measured for village sled dogs along the Yukon River. A reference kennel, maintained on a nutritionally balanced commercial diet, was also measured for comparison. Total antioxidant status was inversely correlated with the external stressor mercury.
Psychological distress is common in patients with diabetes. Little is known about the impact of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a non-traditional, cognitive behavioural intervention designed to improve stress management skills, in patients with diabetes. The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the impact of MBSR training on mood states in 25 individuals with diabetes. All participants completed the Profile of Mood States Short Form (POMS-SF) at baseline and following eight weeks of MBSR. Overall psychological distress measured by the total mood score (TMS) and six subscales - including tension/anxiety, depression/dejection, anger/hostility, fatigue/inertia, confusion/bewilderment and vigour/activity - were assessed. Overall mood, measured by the TMS, as well as all subscale mood measurements improved significantly from baseline following MBSR training. Compared to population means, those with diabetes had higher distress at baseline and similar levels of distress following MBSR training. The primary reason participants reported for enrolling in the MBSR course was to improve stress management skills. It was concluded that MBSR training is a promising, group-based intervention that can be used to decrease psychological distress in individuals with diabetes who perceive a need for training in stress management.
The process of drug discovery and development today encompass a myriad of paths for bringing a new therapeutic molecule that has minimal adverse effects and of optimal use to the patient. Chirality was proposed in the direction of providing a purer and safer form of drug [Ex- cetrizine and levocetrizine]. Decades have passed since the introduction of this concept and numerous chiral molecules are in existence in therapeutics, yet somehow this concept has been ignored. This review aims to rediscover the ignored facts about chirality, its benefits and clear some common myths considering the example of S-Metoprolol in the management of Hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.
To assess the lipid profiles in childhood and youth onset type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and study their association with microvascular complications.
The combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea has been recommended for treatment of type 2 diabetes. A, scored, breakable, extended release, once daily fixed dose combination (FDC) of gliclazide and metformin is available in India.
Hypertension can present in crisis form as 'hypertensive urgency'(HU) or as 'hypertensive emergency' (HE). Both the conditions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Children with new onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at risk of developing the life-threatening condition ketoacidosis if they have a delayed diagnosis. The rate of children presenting in ketoacidosis remains high in a number of countries worldwide. To ensure interventions to raise awareness of symptoms are effective a systematic review was conducted to evaluate previous publicity campaigns.
The role of immune activation in Functional Dyspepsia (FD) patients without previous infection is unclear. We compare the gastric and circulating brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), receptor potential vanilloid type (TRPV) families and various cytokines in FD patients.
It is not uncommon to be treating people with addiction who also have significant other health problems, including heart, renal or liver failure, diabetes and vascular disease. These conditions require regular medications to be taken. This can be a problem for people living with addiction and difficult social circumstances affecting compliance, among other issues. Our perspective provides a summary of general pharmacological factors affecting medicine taking in people with addiction problems, to provide a guide for hospital doctors in this setting.
We describe three cases of severe hyponatraemia in the setting of primary polydipsia that were managed in our centre in 2016. Despite receiving different solute loads, large volume diuresis and rapid correction of serum sodium occurred in all cases. Given the potentially catastrophic consequence of osmotic demyelination, we highlight the judicious use of desmopressin and hypotonic fluid infusion to mitigate sodium overcorrection in this setting.
Many common herbs and spices are claimed to have blood sugar lowering properties that make them useful for people with or at high risk of diabetes. The main of compounds of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa), rhubarb (Rheum ribes), membrane inner of egg shell, wool of sheep, human fingernail (unguis), hyaluronic acid produced by the Bifidobacterium, and usnic acid of Aspicilia lichen were extracted by different methods. All compounds of the extract were divided into five groups. We used variables such as pH, different compounds, concentration, number of injections, and blood glucose monitoring in different situations. Our study, extracts changed to nanoform. The extract compounds and nanoparticles were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscope. The average size of the nanoparticles was found to be 55�nm. Five groups of nanoparticles were injected into rats, and they reduced their blood glucose levels significantly (statistical significance was declared at p�<�0.05). The synthesized hyaluronic acid helped to treat diabetes in rats. Copyright � 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
To investigate the effect of tadalafil on bladder blood flow and lower urinary tract function in a rat model of diabetes.
Maternal gestational diabetes (GDM) is known to influence fetal physiology. Phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA), an innovative signal processing technique, can be used to investigate signals obtained from fetal heart. The PRSA calculated variables "average acceleration capacity" (AAC) and "average deceleration capacity" (ADC) are established indices of autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of gestational diabetes on the fetal ANS in human pregnancy using PRSA.
Colorectal and stomach cancers are the top ranking cancers in Oman. Most of the patients are diagnosed at advanced disease stages. The aim of this study is to explore the knowledge of risk factors, symptoms and the time needed to seek medical care for stomach cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) among Omani participants attending 28 local health centres (LHCs) in the governorate of Muscat, the capital city of Oman. The Bowel Cancer/CRC Awareness Measure (CAM) questionnaire (translated into Arabic) was used to collect data from Omani adult participants (aged 18�years and above) who attended the LHCs during the study period. There was a total of 405 participants in the study out of the 500 who were invited (response rate�=�81%). The most recognised risk factors were excessive drinking of alcohol (73.1%) and smoking (70.6%); the least recognised were doing less exercise (37.3%), eating food which was high in salt (26.8%) and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (24.9%). Multinomial logistic regression showed that young participants recognised more risk factors than older participants; highly educated participants recognised more risk factors than the less-educated and married participants recognised more risk factors than single participants. Participants with a high level of education were more likely to identify signs and symptoms of stomach cancer and CRC than less-educated participants. Multinomial logistic regression showed women were more likely than men to report barriers to seeking medical help (fear, difficulty in arranging transport, worried what the doctor might find). Also, participants with less education were more likely to report barriers than the highly educated (worried about wasting the doctor's time, difficulty in arranging transport, did not feel confident talking about symptoms, embarrassed, scared, worried what doctor might find). The majority of participants (93.6%) were not aware of any CRC screening programme or had undergone any screening (98.3) for CRC. Only 52.6% of participants would have a colonoscopy if the doctors advised; the main reasons for refusal were embarrassment (40.0%), lack of trust in the doctors (33.3%) and religious or culture beliefs (21.3%). Around 39% of participants would prefer to have their colonoscopy examination abroad. There is an urgent need to increase the public's awareness of stomach cancer and CRC in Oman, particularly with evidence emerging of an increase in the incidence. School curriculums could include sessions on cancer education and the information be reiterated to students periodically. A strategy to establish a CRC screening programme in Oman might be paramount as the incidence of CRC increased.
Many current guidelines for the assessment of osteoporosis, including those in Kuwait, initiate fracture risk assessment in men and women using BMD T-score thresholds. We compared the Kuwaiti guidelines with FRAX-based age-dependent intervention thresholds equivalent to that in women with a prior fragility fracture. FRAX-based intervention thresholds identified women at higher fracture probability than fixed T-score thresholds, particularly in the elderly.
Obesity is a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia. We examined the influence of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) on prevalence of neoplasia at screening colonoscopy.
The English NHS currently has a policy of providing Health Checks to all 40-74�year olds. Administered in primary care, they aim to identify patients at risk of a range of diseases, including diabetes and heart disease, and facilitate care. This study is the first to use observed data on the effectiveness of the Checks to consider whether they represent a cost-effective use of limited NHS resources.
Ocular vascular occlusions following intraocular procedures are a rare complication. We report a case series of patients with retinal vascular occlusions or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) after anterior and posterior segment surgery and demonstrate possible risk factors.
Lung adenocarcinoma with symptomatic GI metastasis occurs seldom in everyday clinical practice. However, as diagnostic modalities, therapeutic interventions, and supportive care for cancer evolve, it is likely that the clinician might encounter a number of similar cases in the future, and therefore, he should be aware of this rare entity.
In young patients with T1D, neurological manifestations of cerebral hypertension should suggest the possibility of a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). In these patients an inherited prothrombotic risk factor, including factor V Leiden G1691A gene mutation, should be considered during an event of thrombosis. Improving the glycemic control is the first factor that should be controlled in a patient who carries a genetic prothrombotic risk factor. Anticoagulant treatment should be started as son as CVST has been diagnosed. Long-term antithrombotic treatment with tinzaparin 175 IU/kg/day, a low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), could be reliable and well tolerated, although an indefinite special follow-up, including neurological controls, is advisable even in asymptomatic patients.
Given the immune background, we hypothesize that active Grave's hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for an acute phase reaction associated with the use of bisphosphonates. We recommend that in patients with Graves' thyrotoxicosis and hypercalcemia, consider the risk of an acute phase reaction if planning to give bisphosphonate therapy.
Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by cardiac remodeling and impaired diastolic function that may lead to heart failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress, inflammatory cells, and fibrosis in both subendocardial (SEN) and interstitial (INT) areas of the myocardium. Male Wistar rats were allocated to 2 groups of 9 animals, a control (CT) group and streptozotocin-induced diabetes (DM). After 8 weeks, echocardiography morphometry, protein expression, and confocal microscopy in SEN and INT areas of the left ventricle (LV) were performed. The echocardiographic analysis showed that diabetes induction leads to cardiac dilation, hypertrophy, and LV diastolic dysfunction. As compared to CT, the induction of diabetes increased inflammatory cells and fibrosis in both SEN and INT areas of DM myocardium and increased ROS generation only in SEN. Comparing the SEN and INT areas in the DM group, inflammatory cells and fibrosis in SEN were greater than in INT. In conclusion, diabetic myocardium SEN area, wherein oxidative stress was more pronounced, is more susceptible to cardiac dysfunction than INT area. This finding can be important for the understanding of the heart remodeling process occurring in DCM and perhaps to engender targeted therapies to attenuate or revert DCM-related diastolic dysfunction.
Distress can bring about an unfavorable attitude among the patients toward tackling their disease which can affect adherence to medications. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of distress on adherence to medication among patients with diabetes.
The aim of this study was to explore a new classification way in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on complications and comorbidities using Latent Class Analysis, moreover, finding out the factors associated with different latent classes and making specific suggestions. In this study, 5,500 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from ten hospitals in Tianjin, China were selected, and the response rate was 96.2%. Latent Class Analysis was used to cluster patients. After compared the baseline characteristics, multinomial logistic regression was applied. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were classified into four classes. In the univariate analysis, all variables were significant (p<0.05). According to multinomial logistic regression, we found longer duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus, family history of diabetes, older age, obesity and central obesity, female menopause, living in a suburb, having a higher 2hPG at diagnosis, smoking and drinking were associated with the prevalence of complications and comorbidities. In conclusion, LCA was shown to be an effective method for grouping patients with T2DM, which presented a nuanced approach to data reduction. Further research using LCA may be especially useful to investigate causal relationships between complications and the significant factors identified in our study.
Cardiovascular morbidity is the leading cause of death in dialysis patients and many risk factors have been involved in its pathogenesis. Genetic susceptibility may be of importance including polymorphism for matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), which is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of collagen, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminine and elastin. The MMP3 gene promoter contains an insertion/deletion polymorphism characterised by an array of 5 or 6 adenosine residues (5A/6A) at -1612 position. Literature data show that the 5A or 6A allele of the MMP3 gene shows different risk for cardiovascular and overall outcome in general population. The aim was to analyze the -1612 5A/6A promoter polymorphism in a group of hemodialysis patients and to correlate the findings with cardiovascular morbidity and 7-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. This study included 196 patients on hemodialysis for longer than six months at University Medical Center Zvezdara. The leading causes of end stage renal disease were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Venous blood was collected on midweek dialysis session and genotype analysis was performed by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Among the 198 hemodialysis patients, there were 142 (72%) 5A/6A heterozygotes, 12 (6%) 5A/5A homozygotes, and 44 (22%) 6A/6A homozygotes. These data are consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. After 7-year follow-up, the 5A homozygotes showed the lowest all-cause and cardiovascular survival, while the 6A homozygotes showed the highest cardiovascular survival. The 5A allele of the MMP3-gene promoter polymorphism is a potential risk factor in the poor outcome of hemodialysis patients.
Purulent pericarditis is a life-threatening disorder, even in the modern antibiotic era. Although diabetes mellitus is known to be associated with an increased risk of multiple types of infections, purulent pericarditis is extremely rare. We herein report an unusual case of pericarditis caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies arizona that was not associated with any evident underlying immunosuppressive disorder apart from uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because a pet snake was suspected as being the source of infection in the present case, patient education and a detailed review of exposure history could play an important role in treating patients with diabetes mellitus.
Thyroid diseases are closely associated with the development of types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and as a consequence, the development of effective approaches for their treatment is one of the urgent problems of endocrinology. Traditionally, thyroid hormones (TH) are used to correct functions of the thyroid system. However, they are characterized by many side effects, such as their negative effect on the cardiovascular system as well as the ability of TH to enhance insulin resistance and to disturb insulin-producing function of pancreas, exacerbating thereby diabetic pathology. Therefore, the analogues of TH, selective for certain types of TH receptors, that do not have these side effects, are being developed. The peptide and low-molecular weight regulators of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, which regulate the activity of the thyroid axis at the stage of TH synthesis and secretion in thyrocytes, are being created. Systemic and intranasal administration of insulin, metformin therapy and drugs with antioxidant activity are effective for the treatment of thyroid pathology in types 1 and 2 DM. In the review, the literature data and the results of own investigations on pharmacological approaches for the treatment and prevention of thyroid diseases in patients with types 1 and 2 DM are summarized and analyzed.
A trade-off exists in most diabetes therapies between the benefits of good glycemic control and the morbidity of hypoglycemia. Balancing these factors to achieve desired outcomes is a key consideration for personalized diabetes therapy. Hypoglycemia at night (nocturnal hypoglycemia [NH]) is a common but often under-reported problem in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. To better understand the risk for NH, we pooled data from multiple clinical trials of insulin treatment and specifically examined NH risk factors in relation to glycemic goals.
The efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in alleviating erectile dysfunction (ED) of diabetic rats has been demonstrated mainly through a paracrine effect. However, exosomes (EXOs), which are important bioactive substance vectors secreted by ADSCs, have never been associated with ED.
The benefits and risks of long-term testosterone administration have been a topic of much scientific and regulatory interest in recent years.
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) has a high incidence in diabetic patients, with a reported incidence up to 21%. In severe cases of CTS, patients may undergo carpal tunnel release (CTR) surgery, which involves the risk of infection and other complications. To decrease the risk of infection, some physicians provide prophylactic antibiotics. Our study examines the effects of prophylactic antibiotic use, especially in a high-risk, diabetic population.
A single molecular scaffold can be adapted to interact with diverse targets, either separately or simultaneously. Nucleosides and nucleotides in which ribose is substituted with bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane are an example of a versatile drug-like scaffold for increasing selectivity at their classical targets: kinases, polymerases, adenosine and P2 receptors. Also, by applying structure-based functional group manipulations, rigidified adenosine derivatives can be repurposed to satisfy pharmacophoric requirements of various GPCRs, ion channels, enzymes and transporters, initially detected as off-target activities. Recent examples include 5HT2B serotonin receptor antagonists and novel dopamine transporter allosteric modulators. This directable target diversity establishes rigid nucleosides as privileged scaffolds.
To determine if the Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program had positive effects on the patient medically as well as effects on pathological risk factors, functional capacity, and mental health; and the extent to which targets for blood pressure (BP) control in patients with hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are achieved.
Today, obesity epidemic is one of the major health problems of the present century. One of the phenotypes of obesity is metabolically healthy obesity. It seems that these obese individuals suffer less from cardiovascular disease and metabolically unhealthy obesity. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and its relationship with incidence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension in individuals over 20 years in the city of Ahvaz.
Diabetic heart pathology has a serious social impact due to high prevalence worldwide and significant mortality/invalidation of diabetic patients suffered from cardiomyopathy. The pathogenesis of diabetic and diabetes-related cardiomyopathy is associated with progressive loss and impairment of cardiac function due to adverse effects of metabolic, prooxidant, proinflammatory, and pro-apoptotic stress factors. In the adult heart, the transcriptional factor forkhead box-1 (FOXO-1) is involved in maintaining cardiomyocytes in the homeostatic state and induction of their adaptation to metabolic and pro-oxidant stress stimuli. Insulin inhibits cardiac FOXO-1 expression/activity through the IRS1/Akt signaling in order to prevent gluconeogenesis. In diabetes and insulin resistance, both insulin production and insulin-dependent signaling is weakened or absent. Indeed, FOXO-1 becomes overproduced/overactivated in response to stress stimuli. In diabetic cardiac tissue, FOXO-1 overactivity induces the metabolic switch from the glucose uptake to the predominant lipid uptake. FOXO-1 limits mitochondrial glucose oxidation by stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and increases the lipid uptake through up-regulation of surface expression of CD36. In cardiac muscle cells, lipid accumulation leads to lipotoxicity via increased lipid oxidation, oxidative stress, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Indeed, cardiac FOXO-1 levels and activity should be strictly regulated. FOXO-1 deregulation (that is observed in the diabetic heart) causes detrimental effects that finally lead to heart failure.
The phase III clinical trial PERFECT was designed to assess clinical safety and efficacy of intramyocardial CD133(+) bone marrow stem cell treatment combined with CABG for induction of cardiac repair.
In patients with type 2 diabetes and a high cardiovascular risk profile, the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Using real-world data from clinical practice, we aimed to compare cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in new users of SGLT2 inhibitors versus new users of other glucose-lowering drugs, in a population with a broad cardiovascular risk profile.
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired disease characterized by clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder, with increased mortality and morbidity. Venous thrombosis is the most common cause of mortality in PNH. The relationship between PNH and cerebrovascular disease is unclear; few cases are reported in the literature, most of them related to cerebral venous thrombosis; In PNH the involvement of intracranial and extracranial arterial sites is very rare. We report a case of a 49-year-old woman who has a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and PNH and presented multiple lacunar strokes in a routine consultation with a hematologist. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed lacunar infarcts, and magnetic resonance image showed acute ischemic stroke, multiple territory lacunar infarctions, and focal area of microbleeds in gradient echo sequence. A CT angiography showed V3 and V4 branches of the left vertebral artery occluded by a thrombus, and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery occluded, whereas the carotid system was normal. We discuss the presentation and physiopathology of stroke in PNH and other cases reported in the literature review.
Agenesis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is a rare vascular anomaly that was first observed postmortem. Various anastomoses supply the distal vessels at the site of agenesis. Of these anastomoses, an intercavernous anastomosis is very rare. This paper presents a patient with ischemic stroke in whom we discovered left ICA agenesis and an ipsilateral intercavernous anastomosis.

Intensive care units are favourable environment for infections, many of them are caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria.
In recent years, the role of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in energy homeostasis through modulation of the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and the production of incretin hormones is well recognized.
This study focuses on two inflammatory diseases, viz., "diabetes mellitus (DM)" that causes serious complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, and "ischemic colitis" which is evoked by DM. Ischemic colitis originates from the reduction in mesenteric blood flow to the colon with existence of the occlusive or non-occlusive reasons. Our study objective was to provide early diagnostic approach for ischemic colitis in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: (i) control use of 0.1�M citrate buffer, the solvent of streptozotocin (C), (ii). induced ischemia (I), (iii) rats subjected to 60�mg/kg STZ intraperitoneally to induce type 1 diabetes (D) (48�h after STZ injection, blood glucose levels�>200�mg/dl were considered as diabetic), and (iv) diabetic rats subjected to intestinal ischemia (D+I). The third diabetic group (D) was not operated. At the end of the experimental period, rats were sacrificed, C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin levels were measured in the serum and colon tissue specimens. Tissue specimens were also analyzed histologically. We found that serum and colon calprotectin levels were elevated in the D+I group compared to the D and/or I group alone, but relatively calprotectin levels increased in I as compared to C group in colon tissues. CRP levels were significantly increased with ischemic colitis in diabetes, while colon CRP levels were decreased. These results provide evidence for the existence of inflammation in the STZ-induced diabetic rats with ischemic colitis. In conclusion, our measurements of serum calprotectin levels of STZ-induced diabetic rats with ischemic colitis provide a practical approach for an early diagnosis of ischemic colitis. Furthermore, these biochemical analyses correlate well with the histopathologic findings of STZ-induced diabetic rats with ischemic colitis. Future studies would be desirable to further strengthen the role of calprotectin in the early diagnosis of ischemic colitis in diabetics clinical settings.
A combined molecular docking, QM, and QM/MM dynamics modeling complemented with electron-density based descriptors computed at the B3LYP/6-311G++(d,p) level of theory have been carried out in order to understand the ability of the drugs rhodanine (RD) and 2,4-thiazolidinedione (TZD) in the effective treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The global HOMO/LUMO descriptors provided just a very rough estimate of the chemical reactivity of both molecules, while the features of electron density studied in terms of its Laplacian and electrostatic potential allowed identifying the local electron rich/poor sites which were associated with the regions of electrophilic/nucleophilic attacks in RD and TZD. These results were thoroughly checked using the novel physically-grounded functional descriptors such as the phase-space Fisher information density and the internal kinetic electronic pressure density, which confirmed the information on bonding and lone electron pair details. The molecular docking, QM, and QM/MM dynamics analyses revealed the detailed picture of interactions of the drugs with the amino acid residues of the active site of the human pancreatic alpha-amylase protein (hPAA). The main difference in behavior of RD and TZD molecules is related to the hydrogen bond between the NH group of the ligand and Asp197. In hPAA complex with RD the proton from the NH group, which carries large positive charge (~ +0.45 e), spontaneously transfers to the carboxyl group of Asp197 and stays there, while in complex with TZD this proton frequently changes its position with the more preferable formation of covalent bond with the N atom. Upon deprotonation of the ligand, its hydrogen bonds with Arg195 and His299 become stronger. This process influences the binding with the difference of the binding constants of RD and TZD about 200 times with the higher value corresponding to the RD molecule. Thus, the cumulative results lead to the conclusion that rhodanine would have a higher binding affinity than the 2,4-thiazolidinedione molecule in the active site of human pancreatic alpha-amylase.
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have become the major public health challenges globally. Mitochondrial uncoupling, which reduces intracellular lipid loads and corrects the underlying cause of insulin resistance, has emerged as a promising anti-obese and anti-diabetic intervention. Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug approved by the US FDA with the mechanism of action that uncouples mitochondria of parasitic worms. Recently, niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NEN) was found to be a safe and effective hepatic mitochondrial uncoupler for the prevention and treatment of obesity and T2D in mouse models. The striking features of NEN prompt us to examine the anti-obese and anti-diabetic efficacy of other salt forms of niclosamide, with the ultimate goal to identify a suitable salt formulation for future clinical development. Here, we report the study with niclosamide piperazine salt (NPP), another salt form of niclosamide with documented safety profile.
Our aim was to compare optic disc parameters, retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and macular ganglion cell layers between children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus (type 1) and healthy controls.
To examine trends overtime in the incidence and in-hospital outcomes of vascular dementia (VaD) hospitalisations in patients aged 70 years or over suffering and not suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) between 2004 and 2013 in Spain.
Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major international health problem. Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of healthcare interventions, specifically targeting patients with poorly controlled T2DM, which seek to improve glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk in primary care settings.
Musculoskeletal disorders and cognitive diseases are prevalent, and they are significant determinants of morbidity and mortality in older adults.

To investigate the effect of age at growth hormone (GH) treatment start on near adult height (NAH) in children with isolated GH deficiency (GHD).
Increased platelet aggregation during antiplatelet therapy may predict cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. The majority of these patients receive aspirin monotherapy. We aimed to investigate whether high platelet-aggregation levels predict cardiovascular events in stable coronary artery disease patients treated with aspirin.
Animal models have suggested that CCR2-dependent signalling contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, but global blockade of CCL2 failed to improve the clinical course of patients with lung fibrosis. However, as levels of CCR2(+)CD4(+) T cells in paediatric lung fibrosis had previously been found to be increased, correlating with clinical symptoms, we hypothesised that distinct CCR2(+) cell populations might either increase or decrease disease pathogenesis depending on their subtype.
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although the effect of high glucose on liver function has been described, the role of MIF in hepatic mitochondrial function during T2DM has not been studied.
Early interventions in prediabetes can prevent or delay the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM) on the prevention of T2DM.
Tension pneumothorax, a major preventable cause of battlefield death, often arises from chest trauma and is treated by needle decompression to release trapped air from the pleural cavity. Surgical simulation mannequins are often employed to train medical personnel to perform this procedure properly. Accurate reproduction of the mechanical behavior of the parietal pleura, especially in response to needle penetration, is essential to maximize the fidelity of these surgical simulators. To date, however, the design of pleura-simulating material has been largely empirical and based on subjective practitioner feel rather than on the tissue properties, which have remained unknown. In this study, we performed uniaxial extension tests on samples of cadaveric human parietal pleura. We found that the pleura was highly nonlinear and mildly anisotropic, being roughly twice as stiff in the direction parallel to the ribs vs. perpendicular to the ribs (large-strain modulus = 20.44 vs. 11.49MPa). We also did not find significant correlations for most pleural properties with age or BMI, but it must be recognized that the age range (59 � 9.5 yrs) and BMI range (31 � 5.3) of the donors in our study was not what one might expect from combatants, and there could be differences for younger, lighter individuals. We found a significantly higher low-strain modulus in the diabetic donors (0.213 vs. 0.100MPa), consistent with the general tendency of tissue to stiffen in diabetes. The nonlinearity and tensile strength should be considered in material design and selection for future surgical simulators.
Helicobactor pylori (H. pylori) have the potential role in the pathogenesis of various extra-gastric disorders such as metabolic disorders. But, it is now questioned about whether H. pylori eradication reduces or induces the risk for metabolic disorders especially in patients with dyspepsia. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the effects of H. pylori eradication on criteria of metabolic syndrome.
To describe the relationship between daily physical activity (steps/day and self report method) and health indices. Also to observe relationship between daily physical activity and existence of any prior sign of metabolic syndrome in middle aged adults of 40-60 years. A secondary objective was to observe relation between objective (steps/day) and subjective (IPAQ) measure of physical activity.
Obesity, smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, and poor dental health are modifiable risk factors for revision total joint arthroplasty. To protect patients from revision surgery while also reducing cost, some joint arthroplasty practices use these conditions as contraindications until they are improved. However, this practice is variable among joint arthroplasty surgeons. We hypothesize that a relatively high rate of revision arthroplasty patients had modifiable risk factors at the time of primary surgery.
Chronic hepatitis affects phenotypes of innate and adaptive immune cells. Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are enriched in the liver as compared to the blood, respond to intra-hepatic cytokines, and (via the semi-invariant T-cell receptor) to bacteria translocated from the gut. Little is known about the role of MAIT cells in livers of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and their fate after antiviral therapy.
Measurement of insulin and its therapeutic analogs is important in diabetes, hypoglycemia, sports anti-doping and toxicology. Commercial insulin immunoassays fail to detect commonly prescribed insulin analogs. Because of their unique sequences and masses, these analogs are readily measured and distinguished with mass spectrometric (MS) assays. Reviewed here is an insulin mass spectrometric immunoassay (MSIA) that combines micro-scale immunoaffinity capture with sensitive MS detection of insulin and its therapeutic analogs. An antibody reactive to all insulin analogs was used to affinity capture the insulin analogs. Following elution, insulins were detected with MALDI-TOF MS or LC-MS analysis. Isotopic resolution for insulin was achieved for both MS techniques, and several insulin analogs were detected at unique m/z signals. Porcine insulin, spiked in all samples, served as an internal reference standard for quantification. Linear standard curves spanning three orders of magnitude were obtained, with limits of detection of 15pM for the MALDI-TOF MS and 1.5pM for the LC-MS. This insulin assay was capable of detecting and quantifying not only human endogenous insulin, but also most of the therapeutic insulin analogs, which could find use in diagnosis of severe hypoglycemia and in sports anti-doping.
Gastric bypass has been thought to be associated with a risk of gastric cancer, particularly in Asia. Sleeve gastrectomy with duodenojejunal end-to-side anastomosis (SG-DJESA) was suggested to be a better-designed procedure to avoid this risk, and it also has other advantages.
The study sought to determine the risk factors for post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) dialysis and to determine the impact of pre-TAVR or post-TAVR dialysis on mortality.
The study sought to compare clinical outcomes in a contemporary acute coronary syndrome (ACS) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) cohort stratified by chronic kidney disease (CKD) status.
The metabolome, although very dynamic, is sufficiently stable to provide specific quantitative traits related to health and disease. Metabolomics requires balanced use of state-of-the-art study design, chemical analytics, biostatistics, and bioinformatics to deliver meaningful answers to contemporary questions in human disease research. The technology is now frequently employed for biomarker discovery and for elucidating the mechanisms underlying endocrine-related diseases. Metabolomics has also enriched genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in this area by providing functional data. The contributions of rare genetic variants to metabolome variance and to the human phenotype have been underestimated until now.
This study sought to determine and compare the metabolic control of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in non-Nordic immigrants and native Nordics. The aim was also to describe and compare the request of supportive care between these two groups.
With the progressive increase in life expectancy of HIV-positive patient, thanks to "highly active antiretroviral therapy" (HAART), new comorbidities, and especially cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are emerging as an important concern. An increased risk of coronary artery disease, often in a younger age, has been observed in this population. The underlying pathophysiology is complex and partially still unclear, with the interaction of viral infection-and systemic inflammation-antiretroviral therapy and traditional risk factors. After an accurate risk stratification, primary prevention should balance the optimal HAART to suppress the virus-avoiding side-effects-the intervention on life-style and the treatment of traditional risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes). Also the management after a cardiovascular event is challenging: revascularization strategies-both percutaneous and surgical-are valuable options, keeping in mind the higher rates of recurrent events, and caution is essential to avoid drug-drug interactions. Large evidence-based data on HIV-infected patients are still lacking, and recommendations often follow those of general population. Therefore we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the literature to analyze the current knowledge on CVD's prevalence, prevention and treatment in HIV-infected patients.
The endocrine system is a complex group of organs and glands that relates to multiple other organs and systems in the body with the ultimate goal of maintaining homeostasis. This complex network functions through hormones excreted by several glands and released in the blood, targeting different body tissues and modulating their function. Any primary disorders affecting the endocrine glands and altering the amount of hormones synthesized and released will lead to disruption in the functions of multiple organs. The central nervous system of a developing child is particularly sensitive to endocrine disorders. A variety of neurological manifestations have been described as features of several endocrine diseases in childhood. Their knowledge may contribute to an early diagnosis of a particular endocrine condition, especially when more typical features are not present yet. In this article, we discuss specific neurological manifestations found in various endocrine disorders in children.
Altered skin integrity increases the chance of infection, impaired mobility, and decreased function and may result in the loss of limb or, sometimes, life. Skin is affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors can include altered nutritional status, vascular disease issues, and diabetes. Extrinsic factors include falls, accidents, pressure, immobility, and surgical procedures. Ensuring skin integrity in the elderly requires a team approach and includes the individual, caregivers, and clinicians. The twenty-first century clinician has several online, evidence-based tools to assist with optimal treatment plans. Understanding best practices in addressing skin integrity issues can promote positive outcomes with the elderly.
The benefit of statin therapy in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease remains uncertain. Randomized trials have questioned the efficacy of the drug in improving outcomes for on-dialysis populations, and many patients with end-stage renal disease are not currently taking statins. This study aimed to investigate the impact of statin use on survival of patients with vascular access performed at a vascular center for chronic dialysis. Consecutive end-stage renal disease patients admitted for vascular access surgery in 2006 to 2013 were reviewed. Information on therapy was retrieved and patients on statins were compared to those who were not on statins. Primary endpoint was 5-year survival. Independent predictors of mortality were assessed with Cox regression analysis adjusting for covariates (ie, age, sex, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, diabetes, and statins). Three hundred fifty-nine patients (230 males; mean age 68.9 � 13.7 years) receiving 554 vascular accesses were analyzed: 127 (35.4%) were on statins. Use of statins was more frequent in patients with hypertension (89.8% v 81%; P = .034), hyperlipidemia (52.4% v 6.2%; P < .0001), coronary disease (54.1% v 42.6%; P = .043), diabetes (39.4% v 21.6%; P = .001), and obesity (11.6% v 2.0%; P < .0001). Mean follow-up was 35 months. Kaplan-Meier survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 84.4% and 75.9% for patients taking statins and 77.0% and 65.1% for those not taking statins (P = .18). Cox regression analysis selected statins therapy as the only independent negative predictor (odds ratio = 0.55; 95% confidence interval = 0.32-0.95; P = .032) of mortality, while age was an independent positive predictor (odds ratio = 1.05; 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.08; P < .0001). Vascular access patency was comparable in statin takers and those not taking statins (P = .60). Use of statins might halve the risk of all-cause mortality at 5 years in adult patients with vascular access for chronic dialysis. Statins therapy should be considered in end-stage renal disease populations requiring dialysis access placement.
Clinical guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes recommend individual therapy considering age, duration of disease, presence of complication and risk of hypoglycaemia. However, at present, the patient's sex has no impact on clinical decisions. Yet, there is mounting data pointing at biological and psychosocial differences between men and women with great impact on progression of disease and complications. Moreover, choices and preferences of therapeutic strategies as well as adherence to lifestyle and pharmacological interventions differ in both sexes. In addition, drug therapy may have sex-specific side effects. Therefore, there is need of more research on biological differences and of evidence-based individualised targeted sex-sensitive therapeutic concepts. Clinical guidelines must consider relevant sex-differences. Development and implementation of sex-specific programs may help to improve adherence to therapy and to reduce progression of disease and development of complications. A more gender-sensitive clinical approach may improve quality of life and increase health and life expectancy in men and women with type 2 diabetes.
Hypoglycemia is one of the major challenges in diabetes management for most patients, especially among those with type 1 diabetes. Clinical studies have shown that hypoglycemia can lead to cognitive dysfunction and behavioral impairment. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can provide continuous, comprehensive, and reliable blood glucose information and facilitate the early detection and evaluation of hypoglycemia, thereby providing guidance for the treatment for hypoglycemia. In this article by Van Beers et�al. (1) , the authors carried out a randomized, open-label, crossover trial. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Diabetes has become a major global health problem. The elucidation of characteristic metabolic alterations during the diabetic progression is critical for better understanding its pathogenesis and identifying potential biomarkers and drug targets. Metabolomics is a promising tool to reveal the metabolic changes and the underlying mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. The present review provides an update on the application of metabolomics in diabetic complications, including diabetic coronary artery disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy, and this review provides notes on the prevention and prediction of diabetic complications.

To understand the scope for improving children's glycaemic outcomes by reducing variation between clinics and examine the role of insulin regimen and clinic characteristics.
To determine the prevalence of adverse clinical outcomes, the rates of healthcare utilization, and the incidence of post-partum Type 2 diabetes in refugees with gestational diabetes (GDM), compared with other immigrants and non-immigrants.
Although some studies have shown a link between self-rated health (SRH) and glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (DM), other studies have failed to support this association. The purpose of this study was to determine whether these equivocal findings can be explained by specific interactions between gender, race, and SRH, as suggested by the intersectionality literature.
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with depressive symptoms, but the causal direction of this association and the underlying mechanisms, such as increased glucose levels, remain unclear. We used instrumental-variable regression with a genetic instrument (Mendelian randomization) to examine a causal role of increased glucose concentrations in the development of depressive symptoms.
The access of the young people to the university marks a fundamental break in their lives that may also result in a substantial change in their dietary habits. The aim of this study was to characterize the food patterns, body composition and biochemical profiles of Galician�university students from the University of Santiago de Compostela (Campus de Lugo). A total of 62 students participated in this survey. For each individual, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid profile were measured. Also, the participants filled questionnaires of dietary habits, Mediterranean and Atlantic diet adherence, risk of type II diabetes and physical activity, lifestyle and personal and family histories. A BMI within the normal range was shown by 72% of students. Eight volunteers (12.90%) presented high levels of total cholesterol (>200�mg/dL), and 54.55% of women had levels of HDL-cholesterol above 60�mg/dL. Five students had levels of glucose above 100�mg/dL, being four men and one woman. None of the participants presented high blood pressure, but 11.29% were in pre-hypertension status. The intake of carbohydrates was below the recommendations, while protein and lipids were above. There was an excessive consumption of bakery, alcohol beverages, sausages and ready-made food. The students showed medium adherence to Atlantic and Mediterranean diet and low risk of type II diabetes mellitus and a sedentary lifestyle. Since university students are a group especially prone to poor dietary habits, it seems necessary to promote changes towards healthier meals and rescue the Mediterranean-like dietary pattern.
Insights into physiological mechanisms responsible for weight loss after bariatric surgery (BS) have challenged the traditional view that mechanical restriction and caloric malabsorption are major drivers of weight loss and health benefits after BS. Altered diet selection with an increased postoperative preference for low-sugar and low-fat food has also been implicated as a potential mechanism beyond mere reduction of calorie intake. However, the empirical support for this phenomenon is not uniform and evidence is largely based on indirect measurements, such as self-reported food intake data, which are prone to inaccuracy due to their subjective character.
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as the concomitant disease process of obesity and at least two of the following variables: diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, or reduced high-density lipoprotein. These entities are well established as risk factors for complications following surgery. Obese patients are particularly prone to the development of MetS. The authors therefore aimed at elucidating the impact of MetS on the perioperative panniculectomy outcomes.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) is a recently recognized disease entity defined by the presence of EBV in gastric carcinoma cells. EBV infection causes major epigenetic alterations in the EBV genome and its cellular host genome, suggesting that EBV acts as a direct epigenetic driver for EBVaGC. One of the major epigenetic events in the viral and cellular genomes to control transcription is DNA hypo- or hyper-methylation. Particularly, local and global hypermethylation have been reported in EBVaGC. It is therefore important to understand the molecular mechanisms of DNA hypermethylation during EBVaGC carcinogenesis. To understand the functional roles of DNA methylation and suggest therapeutic target candidates for EBVaGC, we reviewed recent literature reporting DNA hypermethylation in EBVaGC. We summarized the identified candidate genes that are markedly hypermethylated in EBVaGC, which can potentially be targets for chemotherapies with demethylating agents.
Enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and down-regulated SERCA2a expression play crucial roles in diabetes. We aimed to verify whether erythropoietin (EPO) attenuates cardiac dysfunction by suppressing ER stress in diabetic rats.
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are considered chronic inflammatory diseases. While early publications have reported the implication of innate immune cells such as macrophages to promote systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunctions, recent publications underline the alterations of the T cell compartment in human obesity and type 2 diabetes. These recent findings are the focus of this review.
Diabetic complications affecting the kidneys, retina, nerves, and the cardiovasculature are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetes. This paper aims to review the current understanding of the genetic basis of these complications, based on recent findings especially from genome-wide association studies.
It is known that diabetic patients have changes in cortical morphometry as compared to controls, but it remains to be clarified whether the visual cortex is a disease target, even when diabetes complications such as retinopathy are absent. Therefore, we compared type 2 diabetes patients without diabetic retinopathy with control subjects using magnetic resonance imaging to assess visual cortical changes when retinal damage is not yet present.
Delayed post-polypectomy bleeding (PPB) is an infrequent but serious adverse event after colonoscopic polypectomy. Several studies have tried to identify risk factors for delayed PPB, with inconsistent results. This meta-analysis aims to identify significant risk factors for delayed PPB.
Hypoglycemia and fear of hypoglycemia may contribute to basal insulin discontinuation, poor glycemic control, and increased healthcare burden in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to determine the impact of hypoglycemia soon after basal insulin initiation on treatment discontinuation and economic outcomes in patients with T2D.
In hemodialysis (HD), switching from erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) originators to biosimilars is associated with the need for doses approximately 10% higher, according to industry-driven studies.
Recent data suggest a wide range of conversion (4.9-20%) from laparoscopic (LC) to open cholecystectomy (OC) despite increasing surgeon familiarity and superior equipment. Previously identified risk factors for conversion include increased age, male gender, diabetes, and emergent surgeries. Recent studies also suggest that formal minimally invasive surgical training (MIST) reduces conversion rates. We sought to determine conversion rates in our population, a rural academic medical center, and identify any significant risks for conversion.
The gold standard for the objective diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is ambulatory-pH monitoring off medications. Increasingly, impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring on medications is being used to evaluate refractory symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine whether an MII-pH test on medications can reliably detect the presence of GERD.
The majority of infants with neonatal diabetes mellitus present with severe ketoacidosis at a median of 6�weeks. The treatment is very challenging and can result in severe neurological sequelae or death. The genetic defects that cause neonatal diabetes are present from birth. We aimed to assess if neonatal diabetes could be diagnosed earlier by measuring glucose in a dried blood spot collected on day 5 of life.
The main aims of the present study were: (1) to assess the expression and content of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) in human and db/db mouse retinas, and in human vitreous fluid; and (2) to determine whether the topical administration of the DPP-IV inhibitors (DPP-IVi) would prevent retinal neurodegeneration and vascular leakage in db/db mice by reducing endogenous glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) degradation.
The aim of this study was to determine whether therapy with the cytokine IL-22 could be used to prevent the development of, or treat, autoimmune diabetes in the NOD mouse.
Although it has been recently shown that type 2 diabetics have an increased risk of hip fracture, the effects of exercise therapy to prevent this have not been clarified. We examined whether a treadmill running exercise contributes to the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone microarchitecture of the femur and what kind of exercise intensity and duration are optimum in type 2 diabetes mellitus using KK-Ay diabetic mice. The mice were divided into two running groups, one fast speed and short duration (FS), the other slow speed and long duration (SL), and a group of controls with no running (CO). The running exercise was started when the mice were 8�weeks of age, and continued once a day 5�days per week for 10�weeks. Ten weeks after the start of the running exercise, the BMD of the proximal region and mid-diaphysis in the SL were significantly higher in comparison with that in the CO, whereas there was no difference in bone microarchitecture among the three groups. Blood glucose, insulin levels, and visceral fat contents in the SL were significantly lower than those in the CO and FS. Bone resorption protein and C-reactive protein levels in the SL were significantly lower than those in the CO. These results suggest that slow, long duration loading is better for both bone and glycemic control than fast, short duration loading in type 2 diabetes.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a key role in the progression of human illnesses, such as autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases, diabetes, and cancer, etc. In this work, we have discribed a novel probe, TPE-TLE, which remarkably displayed AIE property and ratiometric fluorescence emission profiles in the presence of H2O2. This ratiometric fluorescent probe with AIE property exhibits outstanding features such as the well-resolved emission peaks, high sensitivity, high selectivity, low cytotoxicity, and good cell-membrane permeability. These excellent attributes enable us to demonstrate the ratiometric imaging of endogenously produced H2O2 in macrophages and cancer cells based on the novel ratiometric probe with AIE property for the first time. By comparing two kinds of cells, it is firstly found that cancer cells should contain much more endogenous H2O2 than macrophages. We expect that TPE-TLE will be useful fluorescent platform for the development of a variety of ratiometric fluorescent probes with AIE property to achieve unique biological applications.
Obesity-linked insulin resistance is mainly due to fatty acid overload in non-adipose tissues, particularly skeletal muscle and liver, where it results in high production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction. Accumulating evidence indicates that resistance and endurance training alone and in combination can counteract the harmful effects of obesity increasing insulin sensitivity, thus preventing diabetes. This review focuses the mechanisms underlying the exercise role in opposing skeletal muscle insulin resistance-linked metabolic dysfunction. It is apparent that exercise acts through two mechanisms: (1) it stimulates glucose transport by activating an insulin-independent pathway and (2) it protects against mitochondrial dysfunction-induced insulin resistance by increasing muscle antioxidant defenses and mitochondrial biogenesis. However, antioxidant supplementation combined with endurance training increases glucose transport in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle in an additive fashion only when antioxidants that are able to increase the expression of antioxidant enzymes and/or the activity of components of the insulin signaling pathway are used.
Previous studies have shown that diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects both unmyelinated and myelinated afferents, similar to those evoking the exercise pressor reflex. However, the effect of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) on this reflex is not known. We examined, in decerebrate, male and female T1DM rats (STZ) and healthy controls (CTL), pressor and cardioaccelerator responses to isometric contraction of the hindlimb muscles, during the early and late stages of the disease. Streptozotocin (STZ; 50mg/kg) was injected to induce diabetes and experiments were conducted at 1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks following injection. On the day of the experiment, we statically contracted the hindlimb muscles by stimulating the sciatic nerve and measured changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). We found that the pressor but not cardioaccelerator response was exaggerated in STZ rats at 1 week (STZ: 21�3 mmHg, n=10; CTL: 14�2 mmHg, n=10; p<0.05) and at 3 weeks (STZ: 26�5 mmHg, n=10; CTL: 17�3 mmHg, n=11, p<0.05) following injection. However, at 6 weeks, and only in males, both the pressor (STZ: 13�3 mmHg, n=12; CTL: 17�3 mmHg, n=13, p<0.05) and cardioaccelerator responses (STZ: 7�3 bpm, n=12; CTL: 10�3 bpm, n=13, p<0.05) to contraction was significantly attenuated in STZ rats compared to CTL. These data indicate that T1DM exaggerates the exercise pressor reflex during the early stages of the disease in both male and female rats. Conversely, T1DM attenuates this reflex in the late stage of the disease in male but not female rats.
Depressive symptoms are common in people with type 2 diabetes and contribute to adverse health consequences that substantially impact social and vocational function. Despite the existence of effective depression treatments, the majority of people with type 2 diabetes do not access these when needed. Web-based alternatives to more traditional psychotherapies offer a potential solution to reducing the personal and economic burdens of type 2 diabetes.
Vitamin D is associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) occurrence by affecting insulin secretion and resistance. However, variations exist due to differences in vitamin D sensitivity among individuals. We investigate the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status and various indices of DM in a Korean population without DM.
The association of 9p21.3 locus single nucleotide polymorphisms with arterial ischemic stroke in adults was demonstrated in many studies, but there are no studies in pediatric arterial ischemic stroke patients. We investigated whether the 9p21.3 locus polymorphism, namely rs10757278, is associated with the arterial ischemic stroke risk in children.
Most organisms have developed an autonomous time-keeping system that generates self-sustained daily fluctuations in behavior and physiological processes. These biological clocks are reset every day by light to adjust physiology to the day/night cycle generated by the rotation of the Earth. Clocks present in organs involved in glucose and lipid metabolism such as the liver, muscle, adipose tissue and pancreas are also reset by feeding cues which permits the local integration of systemic and nutritional signals to switch fuel production and utilization according to the feeding/fasting cycle. However, derangements in this finely tuned system can be induced by extending light exposure, 24/7 food availability and altered food intake patterns, repeated jet-lag and shift-working, promoting metabolic imbalances ranging from body weight gain to the development of insulin resistance and liver diseases. Here, we review recent findings on the link between the clock and metabolic fluxes to maintain whole-body homeostasis, and what clock disruption in mice has revealed about the role of the clock in metabolic regulation.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized histopathologically by the presence of fibrillary amyloid deposits in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), the 37-residue pancreatic hormone, is the major constituent of these amyloid deposits. The propensity of IAPP to form amyloid fibrils is strongly dependent on its primary sequence. An intriguing example is His at residue 18. Although H18 is located outside the amyloidogenic region, it has been suggested that this residue and its charge state play an important role in the kinetics of conformational changes and fibril formation as well as in mediating cell toxicity. To gain more insight into the importance of this residue, we have synthesized four analogues (H18R-IAPP, H18K-IAPP, H18A-IAPP and H18E-IAPP) and we performed a full biophysical study on the properties of these peptides. Kinetic experiments as monitored by thioflavin-T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism and cell toxicity assays revealed that all variants are less fibrillogenic and less toxic than native hIAPP both at neutral pH and at low pH. This demonstrates that the effect of H18 in native IAPP is not simply determined by its charge state, but rather that residue 18 is important for specific intra- and intermolecular interactions that occur during fibril formation and that may involve charge, size and hydrophobicity. Furthermore, our results indicate that H18R-IAPP has a strong inhibiting effect on native hIAPP fibril formation. Together these results highlight the large impact of modifying a single residue outside the amyloidogenic domain on fibril formation and cell toxicity induced by IAPP, opening up new avenues for design of inhibitors or modulators of IAPP aggregation.
The majority of persons currently treated for chronic hepatitis B require long-term or lifelong therapy. New inhibitors of hepatitis B virus entry, replication, assembly, or secretion and immune modulatory therapies are in development. The introduction of these novel compounds for chronic hepatitis B necessitates a standardised appraisal of the efficacy and safety of these treatments and definitions of new or additional endpoints to inform clinical trials. To move the field forward and to expedite the pathway from discovery to regulatory approval, a workshop with key stakeholders was held in September 2016 to develop a consensus on treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinical trials aimed at hepatitis B cure. The consensus reached was that a complete sterilising cure, i.e., viral eradication from the host, is unlikely to be feasible. Instead, a functional cure characterised by sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion, which is associated with improved clinical outcomes, in a higher proportion of patients than is currently achieved with existing treatments is a feasible goal. Development of standardised assays for novel biomarkers toward better defining hepatitis B virus cure should occur in parallel with development of novel antiviral and immune modulatory therapies such that approval of new treatments can be linked to the approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure efficacy or to predict response. Combination of antiviral and immune modulatory therapies will likely be needed to achieve functional hepatitis B virus cure. Limited proof-of-concept monotherapy studies to evaluate safety and antiviral activity should be conducted prior to proceeding to combination therapies. The safety of any new curative therapies will be paramount given the excellent safety of currently approved nucleos(t)ide analogues.
The International Diabetes Federation estimates that approximately 0.4% of the Belgian population is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is similar to other industrialized countries. The prevalence of transgenderism is estimated at 0.6% to 0.7% of all adults in Western populations. In this study, we evaluated whether there was an increased prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in transgender people in the local cohort. Medical records of transgender patients were analyzed retrospectively. From January 1, 2007 until October 10, 2016, 1,081 transgender patients presented at a tertiary reference center to start hormonal treatment. Nine of these 1,081 patients were previously diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1 was diagnosed with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. A 2.3-fold higher prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus was observed in transgender patients. We concluded that type 1 diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in transgender patients than one would expect from population prevalences. This could be a spurious result in a local cohort, because a causal relation seems unlikely, but our finding might encourage other centers to investigate this putative association.

Areca nut chewing has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, but its association with erectile dysfunction (ED) has not been investigated.
Charcot neuroarthropathy of the foot, or Charcot foot, is a pathologic entity of the foot, associated with diabetes mellitus. Owing to the increase of diabetes mellitus in developed nations worldwide, the prevalence of Charcot foot has been increasing. The initial treatment of Charcot foot is often conservative, with methods including bracing, casting, and the use of customized orthopedic shoes. However, many cases of Charcot foot eventually require surgery, because the consequent destabilization of the foot associated with bone, joint, and nerve injury due to the pathology eventually leave patients unable to walk independently. The present systematic review analyzed the published data regarding surgical interventions for midfoot Charcot deformities and estimated the rates of common complications occurring with the surgical modalities studied. The main outcomes of interest analyzed in the present study were postoperative amputation and bony fusion. The included cohort of patients with Charcot foot was very heterogeneous in terms of the demographic and comorbid characteristics. However, even with this heterogeneity, the present study should provide useful information to surgeons in terms of the outcomes after some of the common surgical procedures for midfoot Charcot.
Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent used in the type 2 diabetes, whose poor bioavailability and short half-life make the development of effective extended-release formulations highly desirable. Different metformin-loaded chitosomal and niosomal formulations were developed and suitably characterized, but were unable to provide the desired sustained release. The entrapment of both kinds of colloidal dispersions in calcium alginate beads enabled to strongly reduce the amount of drug released at gastric level (from 18 up to a maximum of 30%), and to obtain a sustained release in simulated intestinal fluid, which was properly tuned by varying the percentage of calcium alginate in the beads. In vivo studies on rats revealed a significant improvement of metformin hypoglycemic effect when orally administered as chitosomal and even more as niosomal dispersion entrapped in alginate beads, not only with respect to the drug as such, but also to the alginate beads loaded with the plain drug. The more intense and sustained therapeutic effect with time provided by the drug-in niosomes-in alginate bead formulation could be very profitable for maintaining tight blood glucose levels over prolonged period of time after oral administration, allowing a reduction of its dose and related collateral effects, and improving patient compliance.
The US Food and Drug Administration has warned that treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors may promote serious arthralgia. However, the clinical evidence for this is relatively lacking.
A routine invasive strategy is recommended for patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). However, optimal timing of invasive strategy is less clearly defined. Individual clinical trials were underpowered to detect a mortality benefit; we therefore did a meta-analysis to assess the effect of timing on mortality.
Despite the need for timely return of patients for visit and blood sugar control, rate of attendance to health centers is low. This qualitative study was conducted to identify and explain the status of diabetics' referral to rural health centers of Ahvaz from the patients and participants' point of view.
Mast cells are stimulatory factors in prognosis of various immunogenic and allergic diseases in human body. These cells play an important role in various immunological and metabolic diseases. The aim of present article is to explore the molecular targets to suppress the over expression of mast cells in obesity. The last 20 years literature were searched by various bibliographic data bases like Pubmed, google Scholar, Scopus and web of Science. The data were collected by keywords like "Mast Cell" "obesity" and "role of mast cell or role in obesity". Articles and their abstract were reviewed with a counting of 827 publications, in which 87 publications were considered for study and remaining was excluded because of its specificity to the subject. This review explains the characteristics, molecular targets and role of mast cells in obesity and existing research with mast cells to the area of metabolic diseases.
To study the presence of several maternal and neonatal complications in a cohort of women with hyperandrogenic as well as normoandrogenic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and women with PCOS who received different fertility treatments.
High sodium intake, whether via diet or drugs, augments cardiorenal risk. Regardless of its source, high sodium intake can both lead to hypertension and reduce the efficacy of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, which are currently guideline-recommended treatments for hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Reducing sodium intake is therefore recommended to reduce the risk of adverse cardiorenal outcomes. An inverse relationship exists between sodium and potassium, with foods high in sodium being lower in potassium. Diets high in potassium have been associated with reducing hypertension and heart failure; however, optimal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor dosing is often limited by hyperkalemia, which can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and increased mortality. Potassium binders are effective at reducing potassium levels. Although some use sodium as the potassium exchange ion, thus increasing sodium intake, a new potassium binder uses another exchange ion and therefore does not increase sodium intake. When treatment options require agents that may precipitate hyperkalemia, particularly in patients at high cardiorenal risk, drugs that do not add to the sodium load may be preferred. A literature search was conducted using PubMed; search terms included potassium, sodium, hyperkalemia, potassium binders, and the literature search focused on manuscripts published more recently since 2000.
Metastatic Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with a poor 5-year-survival rate (<15%). A surgical approach is recommended in selected patients if complete resection of distant metastasis can be achieved. To date there are only limited data on the outcome after surgical resection of hepatic metastases of ACC.
Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes and the risk for development of cardiovascular disease was recently associated as an extended phenotype of the disease. We aimed to assess IR; liver involvement; carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and metabolic alterations associated to cardiovascular risk in A-T patients, and relate them with age.
A small proportion of patients utilizes a disproportionately large amount of emergency department (ED) resources. Being able to properly identify chronic frequent ED users, i.e. frequent ED users over a multiple-year period, would allow healthcare professionals to intervene before it occurs and, if possible, redirect these patients to more appropriate health services. The objective of this study was to explore the factors associated with chronic frequent ED utilization in a population with diabetes.
Obesity is a primary risk factor for many diseases such as certain cancers. In this study, we have developed three algorithms including a random-walk based method OBNet, a shortest-path based method OBsp and a direct-overlap method OBoverlap, to reveal obesity-disease connections at protein-interaction subnetworks corresponding to thousands of biological functions and pathways. Through literature mining, we also curated an obesity-associated disease list, by which we compared the methods. As a result, OBNet outperforms other two methods. OBNet can predict whether a disease is obesity-related based on its associated genes. Meanwhile, OBNet identifies extensive connections between obesity genes and genes associated with a few diseases at various functional modules and pathways. Using breast cancer and Type 2 diabetes as two examples, OBNet identifies meaningful genes that may play key roles in connecting obesity and the two diseases. For example, TGFB1 and VEGFA are inferred to be the top two key genes mediating obesity-breast cancer connection in modules associated with brain development. Finally, the top modules identified by OBNet in breast cancer significantly overlap with modules identified from TCGA breast cancer gene expression study, revealing the power of OBNet in identifying biological processes involved in the disease.
There is no cure for diabetes and its prevention is interesting for both people and health policy makers. The aim of this study was to construct a simple scoring system to predict diabetes and suggest a self assessment predictive model for type 2 diabetes in Iran.
The month of Ramadan represents a golden opportunity for better management of patients with diabetes not only during Ramadan month, but also through the entire year. Pre Ramadan period is crucial for evaluating and preparing patients with diabetes intending to Fast Ramadan. The risk stratification categories should take into consideration patients with diabetes having specific conditions such as nephrotic syndrome who are predisposed to thrombosis independent to their estimated glomerular filtration rate and glycated haemoglobin. Furthermore, population-specific conditions such as nomadic Bedouins living in remote areas should be considered as part of the very high risk category for fasting Ramadan. Published data regarding the use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors during Ramadan is very limited. Dapagliflozin was the only agent studied during Ramadan. Therefore, it is suggested to categorize this group of agents differently from other agents such as metformin and incretin based therapy studied vastly during Ramadan.
Metformin therapy is associated with diffuse intestinal (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in clinical diagnostics using routine FDG-PET imaging. We aimed to study whether metformin induced glucose uptake in intestine is associated with the improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we compared the effects of metformin and rosiglitazone on intestinal glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes in a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial, and further, to understand the underlying mechanism, evaluated the effect of metformin in rats.
Somatic gene therapy is a promising approach for treating otherwise terminal or debilitating diseases. The human skin is a promising conduit for genetic engineering, as it is the largest and most accessible organ, epidermal autografts and tissue-engineered skin equivalents have been successfully deployed in clinical applications, and skin epidermal stem/progenitor cells for generating such grafts are easy to obtain and expand in�vitro. Here, we develop skin grafts from mouse and human epidermal progenitors that were engineered by CRISPR-mediated genome editing to controllably release GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1), a critical incretin that regulates blood glucose homeostasis. GLP-1 induction from engineered mouse cells grafted onto immunocompetent hosts increased insulin secretion and reversed high-fat-diet-induced weight gain and insulin resistance. Taken together, these results highlight the clinical potential of developing long-lasting, safe, and versatile gene therapy approaches based on engineering epidermal progenitor cells.
The increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes is an urgent worldwide health challenge. Now in Cell Stem�Cell, Yue et�al. (2017) report a proof-of-concept study using genetically engineered skin transplants that produce the incretin GLP-1 to prevent diet-induced obesity, suggesting a powerful approach for treating metabolic disorders.
We aimed at comparing the impact of multiple non-traditional biomarkers (ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and four markers of systemic inflammation), both individually and in combination, on cardiovascular risk prediction, over and above traditional risk factors incorporated in the QRISK2 score, in older people with type 2 diabetes.
Diabetic foot ulcers may result in loss of an extremity and may even lead to mortality. The use of comprehensive foot care programs which include early screening and evaluation of problems, foot care education, preventive therapy and referral to specialists has been shown to reduce amputation rates by 49-85 [percent]. A 51-year-old woman with Type 2 diabetes under surveillance for nine months was referred from the emergency department. She presented with an entirely inflamed right foot with ulcer covering two-thirds proximal of the foot for 30 days' duration. There was extensive edema as well as cellulitis extending to the knee, fluctuating abscesses and lymphangitis to the ankle. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive abscesses and edema in foot compartments. After a further four weeks of antibiotics, 80 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy shrank the wound from 15x15x2 cm to 3x3x0.2 cm. The wound was closed with a split thickness graft, and healing completed four months after presentation. Patients with diabetic foot deserve clinical evaluations of the whole body rather than a regional treatment. An interdisciplinary approach involving both medical and surgical treatment options should be conducted according to this perspective. It could be effective in lowering major amputation rates and even preventing amputations. Simultaneously administered effective debridement methods, utilization of minor amputations for necrotic tissue and lowering the infectious load with appropriate antibiotics, aggressive wound care with the appropriate wound care products, unconventional treatment methods like hyperbaric oxygen treatment and negative pressure wound care may help reduce amputation levels and save extremities.
To analyze the clinical characteristics of an infant with neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and to sequence the ABCC8 gene of this family in order to provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment.
Insulin resistance is considered to be a pathogenetic mechanism in several and diverse diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis) often antedating them in apparently healthy subjects. The aim of this study is to investigate with a microarray based approach whether IR per se is characterized by a specific pattern of gene expression. For this purpose we analyzed the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two groups (10 subjects each) of healthy individuals, with extreme insulin resistance or sensitivity, matched for BMI, age and gender, selected within the MultiKnowledge Study cohort (n = 148). Data were analyzed with an ad-hoc rank-based classification method. 321 genes composed the gene set distinguishing the insulin resistant and sensitive groups, within which the "Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes" KEGG pathway was significantly represented, suggesting a pattern of increased intracellular cAMP and Ca2+, and apoptosis in the IR group. The same pathway allowed to discriminate between insulin resistance and insulin sensitive subjects with BMI >25, supporting his role as a biomarker of IR. Moreover, ASCM pathway harbored biomarkers able to distinguish healthy and diseased subjects (from publicly available data sets) in IR-related diseases involving excitable cells: type 2 diabetes, chronic heart failure, and Alzheimer's disease. The altered gene expression profile of the ASCM pathway is an early molecular signature of IR and could provide a common molecular pathogenetic platform for IR-related disorders, possibly representing an important aid in the efforts aiming at preventing, early detecting and optimally treating IR-related diseases.
Rates of diabetes in pregnancy are disproportionately higher among Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal women in Australia. Additional challenges are posed by the context of Aboriginal health including remoteness and disadvantage. A clinical register was established in 2011 to improve care coordination, and as an epidemiological and quality assurance tool. This paper presents results from a process evaluation identifying what worked well, persisting challenges and opportunities for improvement.
Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a�biomarker of aging, and it is associated with lifestyle. It is currently unknown whether LTL is associated with the response to lifestyle interventions. The goal is to assess whether baseline LTL modified the cognitive benefits of a�2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention (exploratory analyses). The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) was a�2-year randomized controlled trial including 1,260 people at risk of cognitive decline, aged 60-77 years identified from the general population. Participants were randomly assigned to the lifestyle intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk management) and control (general health advice) groups. Primary outcome was change in cognition (comprehensive neuropsychological test battery). Secondary outcomes were changes in cognitive domains: memory, executive functioning, and processing speed. 775 participants (392 control, 383 intervention) had baseline LTL (peripheral blood DNA). Mixed effects regression models with maximum likelihood estimation were used to analyze change in cognition as a�function of randomization group, time, baseline LTL, and their interaction. Intervention and control groups did not significantly differ at baseline. Shorter LTL was related to less healthy baseline lifestyle. Intervention benefits on executive functioning were more pronounced among those with shorter baseline LTL (p-value for interaction was 0.010 adjusted for age and sex, and 0.007 additionally adjusted for baseline lifestyle factors). The FINGER intervention cognitive benefits were more pronounced with shorter baseline LTL, particularly for executive functioning, indicating that the multidomain lifestyle intervention was especially beneficial among higher-risk individuals.
Creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in patients with advanced atherosclerotic changes of the artery is often a challenge for the physician due to difficulties in suturing the vein to the side of the frangible artery. The sleeve technique relies on advancing the end of the artery into the lumen of the vein and protecting the anastomosis by adventitial sutures.
The purpose of this study was to identify the expression characteristics of circular RNAs in the peripheral blood of coronary artery disease patients and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
Mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload is implicated in hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial cell dysfunction, but the key molecular events responsible remain unclear. We examined the involvement of mitochondrial calcium uniporter, which mediates mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, in endothelial cell dysfunction resulting from high-glucose treatment.
Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with obesity and diabetes. However, what causes and mediates chronic inflammation in metabolic disorders is not well understood. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediates both infection-induced and sterile inflammation by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and endogenous molecules, respectively. Saturated fatty acids can activate TLR4, and TLR4-deficient mice were protected from high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance, suggesting that TLR4-mediated inflammation may cause metabolic dysfunction, such as obesity and insulin resistance.
To assess differences in the receipt of preventive health services by race/ethnicity among older women with endometrial cancer enrolled in Medicare, we conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer from 2001 to 2011 in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Women with stage I or II endometrial cancer of epithelial origin were included. The exposure was race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic [NH] White, NH Black, Hispanic, and NH Asian/Pacific Islander [PI]). The services examined were receipt of influenza vaccination and screening tests for diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and breast cancer. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, region, and year of diagnosis. A total of 13,054 women were included. In the 2�years after diagnosis, receipt of any influenza vaccine ranged from 45% among NH Black women to 67% among NH White women; receipt of a mammogram ranged from 65% among NH Black women to 74% among NH White women. Relative to NH White women, NH Black women had a lower likelihood of receiving both influenza vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.40, 95% CI 0.33-0.44) and screening mammography (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.79). Hispanic women also were less likely to receive influenza vaccination than NH White women (aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51-0.72). There were no significant differences across racial groups for diabetes or cholesterol screening services. Among older women with early-stage endometrial cancer, racial disparities exist in the utilization of some preventive services.
Post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a rare but growing complication of bariatric surgery with severe, debilitating, potentially life-threatening consequences and no safe and effective treatment. Previous studies involving continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist, exendin (9-39) (Ex-9) in patients with PBH have demonstrated efficacy in preventing symptomatic postprandial hypoglycemia. Subcutaneous (SC) injection of Ex-9 would represent a more practical therapeutic approach. The present first-in-human SC administration study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and tolerability of SC Ex-9 in patients with PBH.
Breastfeeding has many benefits for mother and infant. Whether breastfeeding also protects against type 2 diabetes is unclear. To clarify the role of breastfeeding in type 2 diabetes, we assessed the association of breastfeeding with insulin resistance in late adolescence in a birth cohort from a non-Western setting where breastfeeding was not associated with higher socio-economic position. We used multivariable linear regression, with multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting, to examine the adjusted associations of contemporaneously reported feeding in the first 3�months of life (exclusively breastfed, mixed feeding, or always formula-fed) with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 17�years in a subset (n�=�710, 8.6% of entire cohort) of the Hong Kong Chinese birth cohort "Children of 1997." We found a graded association of breastfeeding exclusivity in the first 3�months of life with lower fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (p-for-trend�<�.05), but not fasting glucose, at 17�years. Exclusively breastfed adolescents (7%) had nonsignificantly lowest fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, adjusted for sex, birth weight, parity, length of gestation, pregnancy characteristics, parents' education, and mother's place of birth. Exclusively breastfeeding for 3�months may be causally associated with lower insulin resistance in late adolescence. Further follow-up studies into adulthood are required to clarify the long-term protection of breastfeeding from type 2 diabetes.
The public mandatory long-term care insurance system in Japan has supposedly mitigated the care burden for family caregivers of older adults, whereas family caregivers still play a considerable role in providing care. The effect of informal caregiving on the caregiver's health has been of great interest. We investigated the relationship between the amplitude of informal caregiving and caregiver participation in health check-ups in Japan.
A majority of patients with diabetes have trigger digits. Initial management of symptomatic trigger digits commonly involves corticosteroid injection. However, varying outcomes have been reported for patients with diabetes who receive corticosteroid injections. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of diabetes on outcome after corticosteroid injection for trigger digit. PubMed and other Internet databases were searched for the period 1977 to 2015. Five articles, involving 381 diabetic digits and 449 non-diabetic digits, were included in the meta-analysis. The authors found treatment failure rates of 78% for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, 47% for patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 49% for patients without diabetes when a single injection of corticosteroid was administered for trigger digit. After 3 injections, the failure rates were 57%, 39%, and 30%, respectively. The pooled data showed that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes had worse prognoses after corticosteroid injection for trigger digit than patients without diabetes. Furthermore, the patients with insulin-dependent diabetes had a trend toward multiple digit involvement and much worse treatment outcomes than the patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The authors conclude that more aggressive treatment, such as surgical intervention, should be considered for those patients expected to have high failure rates after injection. [Orthopedics. 201x; xx(x):xx-xx.].
Arthroscopic Bankart repair, a commonly performed procedure in the United States, is usually done on an outpatient basis. All instances of arthroscopic Bankart repair from 2005 to 2014 from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program prospective database were analyzed. Both univariate analysis and binary logistic regression were performed to determine risk factors for admission following surgery. Of 2291 patients undergoing arthroscopic Bankart repair, 173 (7.6%) required inpatient hospital admission following surgery. Univariate analysis found the following to be associated with admission: female sex (P=.009), age older than 40 years (P<.001), white race (P=.002), body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2) (P=.001), and American Society of Anesthesiologists class greater than 3 (P<.001). Independent predictors of admission on multivariate analysis included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.10; P=.023), increasing age (per year) (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04; P<.001), diabetes (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.30-3.10; P=.006), and longer operation time (per minute) (OR, 1.010; 95% CI, 1.009-1.011; P<.001). This study identified a 7.6% rate of admission following arthroscopic Bankart repair, with diabetes, female sex, increasing age, and longer operation time being independent risk factors for admission. Knowledge of these risk factors is important when setting patient expectations preoperatively and for optimizing care to obtain the best short-term outcome. [Orthopedics. 201x; xx(x):xx-xx.].
The aim of this study was to describe application of a static Qigong program to decrease needle pain in Korean adolescents with type 1 diabetes and its pilot test results. The pilot study was a randomized crossover design including 26 adolescents randomized to Qigong or rest group. Participants received a 60-minute Qigong program consisted of warm up, deep breathing, imaginary, and a closing warm up. After 24-hour washout period, treatment assignments were switched. We collected before and after intervention using a self-administered questionnaire, which included the faces pain scale to assess expected and perceived pain during blood sugar testing and insulin injection and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Only expected pain on insulin injection was significantly lower after intervention ( P = .025). The results suggested that the devised static Qigong program was feasible intervention to decrease at least expected pain on insulin injection of adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
Colonic diverticulosis (CD) is related to advanced age and a lack of dietary fiber. Recently, several studies have shown that metabolic syndrome (MS) is also implicated in the etiopathogenesis of CD. This study aimed to assess the association between MS, obesity and CD.
The mechanism of action (MOA) of the first line type-2 diabetes drug metformin remains unclear despite its widespread usage. However, recent evidence suggests that the mitochondrial copper (Cu)-binding action of metformin may contribute towards the drug's MOA. Here, we present a novel biosensing platform for investigating the MOA of metformin using a magnetic microbead -based agglutination assay which has allowed us to demonstrate for the first time the interaction between Cu and metformin at clinically relevant low micromolar concentrations of the drug, thus suggesting a potential pathway of metformin's blood-glucose lowering action. In this assay, cysteine-functionalized magnetic beadswere agglutinated in the presence of Cu due to cysteine's Cu-chelation property. Addition of clinically relevant doses of metformin resulted in disaggregation of Cu-bridged bead-clusters, whereas the effect of adding a closely-related but blood-glucose neutral drug propanediimidamide (PDI) showed completely different responses to the clusters. The entire assay was integrated in an automated microfluidics platform with an advanced optical imaging unit by which we investigated these aggregation-disaggregation phenomena in a reliable, automated and user-friendly fashion with total assay time of 17 min requiring a sample (metformin/PDI) volume of 30�l. The marked difference of Cu-binding action between the blood-glucose lowering drug metformin and its inactive analogue PDI thus suggests that metformin's distinctive Cu-binding properties may be required for its effect on glucose homeostasis. The novel automated platform demonstrating this novel investigation thus holds the potential to be utilized for investigating significant and sensitive molecular interactions via magnetic bead-based agglutination assay.
The objective is to assess the influence of sociodemographic, professional and clinical variables on the choice of treatment of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). An exhaustive and trans-sectional study was conducted over a period of eight years, from 1st January 2006 to 31 December 2013 in the Department of Occupational Medicine at University Hospital of Mahdia, Tunisia. The study population was represented by patients with work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. Data collection was based on a questionnaire sheet, describing social, occupational and medical characteristics of patients. The study population was characterized by a large female dominance, representing 95.3% with an average age of 42�7.8 years. Patients medically treated represented 38.7% and 61.3% had had surgical treatment. After binary logistic regression, surgical indication of CTS was significantly correlated to diabetes (p=0.017), other musculoskeletal disorders (p=0.02), functional signs of CTS (acrocyanosis p=0.05; muscle weakness p=0.015; radiating pain p=0.01; painful discomfort of the hand, the forearm or arm p=0.027) and to the atrophy of thenar muscles (p=0.018). According to this study, the choice of therapy for occupational CTS depends only on clinical data. More detailed studies will be needed to refine these results.
Urolithiasis is common and is becoming more prevalent worldwide. This study assessed the chronological trends in clinical and urinary metabolic features over 20 years in Korean urolithiasis patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of 4,076 patients treated at our clinic from 1996 to 2015. Urinary metabolic data and stone analysis data were available for 1,421 and 723 patients (34.9% and 17.7%), respectively. Patients were categorized into 4 groups according to the date of initial diagnosis: group 1 (1996-2000, n = 897), group 2 (2001-2005, n = 1,018), group 3 (2006-2010, n = 1,043), and group 4 (2011-2015, n = 1,118). Incidental detection of uric acid renal stones has become more prevalent in the past 10 years, accompanied by an increase in body mass index and age at diagnosis. Similarly, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and of hypertension increased from one group to the next throughout the study period. Levels of 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium, calcium, uric acid, and oxalate have decreased significantly over the study period. The incidence of urinary metabolic abnormalities also showed an identical tendency. The proportion of stones composed of uric acid increased over the study period. In conclusion, incidental detection of uric acid renal stones has become more prevalent in Korea in the past 20 years. Urinary excretion of lithogenic constituents and the incidence of urinary metabolic abnormalities have decreased significantly over this period.
The English community pharmacy New Medicine Service (NMS) significantly increases patient adherence to medicines, compared with normal practice. We examined the cost effectiveness of NMS compared with normal practice by combining adherence improvement and intervention costs with the effect of increased adherence on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.
We used findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study to update our previous publication on the burden of diabetes and chronic kidney disease due to diabetes (CKD-DM) during 1990-2015.
The Eastern Mediterranean Region faces several health challenges at a difficult time with wars, unrest, and economic change.
The Warburg effect is ameliorated by culturing transformed cells in the presence of galactose instead of glucose as the primary carbon source. However, metabolic consequences may occur in addition to sensitizing the cells to mitochondrial toxins. The screening of pharmaceutical agents against transformed cells while using galactose must therefore be carefully evaluated. Pioglitazone is employed in clinical applications to treat type-2 diabetes but clearly has other off-target effects. Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) were cultured in glucose or galactose-containing medium to investigate the role of pioglitazone on cellular bioenergetics by calorimetry and respirometry. Compared with cells cultured in 10�mM glucose, HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of 10�mM galactose showed decreased metabolic activity as measured by cellular heat flow. Interestingly, cellular heat flow increased after the addition of pioglitazone for cells cultured in glucose, but not for cells cultured in galactose. Our calorimetric data indicated that a reduction in cellular capacity for glycolysis was the mechanism responsible for the increase in sensitivity to pioglitazone, and possibly to mitochondrial toxins in general, for cells cultured in galactose. Furthermore, oxygen consumption rates were decreased after the addition of pioglitazone to cells grown in glucose but remained unchanged for cells grown in the presence of galactose. We have demonstrated that pioglitazone induces a reduction in mitochondrial activity that is partially compensated via an increase in glycolysis in the presence of glucose.
Prolonged QT interval is associated with arrhythmias and sudden death. An increased prevalence of QT interval prolongation in human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV) subjects was previously described. The impact of different medications and HIV infection itself on the QT interval is rarely investigated in large HIV+ cohorts.
This study aims to compare the post-prandial curves of glucose, insulin, GLP-1, and GLP-2 among individuals with Crohn's disease (CD), obese individuals before and after bariatric surgery, and healthy controls.
Metformin is a widely-used drug that results in clear benefits in relation to glucose metabolism and diabetes-related complications. The mechanisms underlying these benefits are complex and still not fully understood. Physiologically, metformin has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose production, yet not all of its effects can be explained by this mechanism and there is increasing evidence of a key role for the gut. At the molecular level the findings vary depending on the doses of metformin used and duration of treatment, with clear differences between acute and chronic administration. Metformin has been shown to act via both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms; by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration but also perhaps by inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and a mechanism involving the lysosome. In the last 10�years, we have moved from a simple picture, that metformin improves glycaemia by acting on the liver via AMPK activation, to a much more complex picture reflecting its multiple modes of action. More work is required to truly understand how this drug works in its target population: individuals with type 2 diabetes.
We examined the associations between depressive symptoms and diabetes distress with glycaemic control and diabetes complications over 2�years, after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterised in its early stages by diastolic relaxation abnormalities and later by clinical heart failure in the absence of dyslipidaemia, hypertension and coronary artery disease. Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia are each independent risk factors for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The pathophysiological factors in diabetes that drive the development of cardiomyopathy include systemic metabolic disorders, inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, subcellular component abnormalities, oxidative stress, inflammation and dysfunctional immune modulation. These abnormalities collectively promote cardiac tissue interstitial fibrosis, cardiac stiffness/diastolic dysfunction and, later, systolic dysfunction, precipitating the syndrome of clinical heart failure. Recent evidence has revealed that dysregulation of coronary endothelial cells and exosomes also contributes to the pathology behind diabetic cardiomyopathy. Herein, we review the relationships among insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and the development of cardiac dysfunction. We summarise the current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in diabetic cardiomyopathy and explore potential preventative and therapeutic strategies.
Metformin (dimethylbiguanide) has become the preferred first-line oral blood glucose-lowering agent to manage type 2 diabetes. Its history is linked to Galega officinalis (also known as goat's rue), a traditional herbal medicine in Europe, found to be rich in guanidine, which, in 1918, was shown to lower blood glucose. Guanidine derivatives, including metformin, were synthesised and some (not metformin) were used to treat diabetes in the 1920s and 1930s but were discontinued due to toxicity and the increased availability of insulin. Metformin was rediscovered in the search for antimalarial agents in the 1940s and, during clinical tests, proved useful to treat influenza when it sometimes lowered blood glucose. This property was pursued by the French physician Jean Sterne, who first reported the use of metformin to treat diabetes in 1957. However, metformin received limited attention as it was less potent than other glucose-lowering biguanides (phenformin and buformin), which were generally discontinued in the late 1970s due to high risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin's future was precarious, its reputation tarnished by association with other biguanides despite evident differences. The ability of metformin to counter insulin resistance and address adult-onset hyperglycaemia without weight gain or increased risk of hypoglycaemia gradually gathered credence in Europe, and after intensive scrutiny metformin was introduced into the USA in 1995. Long-term cardiovascular benefits of metformin were identified by the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in 1998, providing a new rationale to adopt metformin as initial therapy to manage hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Sixty years after its introduction in diabetes treatment, metformin has become the most prescribed glucose-lowering medicine worldwide with the potential for further therapeutic applications.
Multiple epidemiological studies have documented an association between metformin, used for treatment of type 2 diabetes, and reduced cancer incidence and mortality. Cell line models may not accurately reflect the effects of metformin in the clinical setting. Moreover, findings from animal model studies have been inconsistent, whilst those from more recent epidemiological studies have tempered the overall effect size. The purpose of this review is to examine metformin's chemopreventive potential by outlining relevant mechanisms of action, the most recent epidemiologic evidence, and recently completed and ongoing clinical trials. Although repurposing drugs with excellent safety profiles is an appealing strategy for cancer prevention and treatment in the adjuvant setting, there is no substitute for well-executed, large randomised clinical trials to define efficacy and determine the populations that are most likely to benefit from an intervention. Thus, enthusiasm remains for understanding the role of metformin in cancer through ongoing clinical research.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide epidemic disorder with considerable health and economic consequences. Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs. Pharmacogenetic studies showed that variants in genes related to the pharmacokinetics of metformin were associated with glucose-lowering effect of metformin. The aim of this study was to evaluate pharmacogenetic variation in SLC47A1 (rs2289669) and metformin response in type 2 diabetes patients. Seventy one patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. The genotypes were determined by Tetra-ARMS-PCR method. There was a significant association between the study polymorphism and the response to metformin treatment with the highest HbA1C reduction in AG genotype. In the dominant model for A allele (AA+AG vs GG), patients with A allele had highest HbA1C reduction in response to metformin.
Whole-grain products such as brown rice have been associated with lower risk of metabolic disorders including diabetes. We examined the acceptability and tolerability of substituting brown rice for white rice and the feasibility of introducing brown rice into the diet through a long-term trial to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is purported as a contributory mechanism underlying diabetic neuropathy, but a defined role for damaged mitochondria in diabetic nerves remains unclear, particularly in standard diabetes models. Experiments here used a high-fat diet in attempt to exacerbate the severity of diabetes and expedite the time-course in which mitochondrial dysfunction may occur. We hypothesized a high-fat diet in addition to diabetes would increase stress on sensory neurons and worsen mitochondrial dysfunction.
American Indians have a high prevalence of diabetes and higher incidence of stroke than that of whites and blacks in the U.S. Stroke risk prediction models based on data from American Indians would be of clinical and public health value.
A new reentry device (Outback Elite) system has been available in Japan since June 2016. This new device enables easier treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the lower extremities. We report a case of a woman in her 70s who underwent revascularization using this new device twice to treat both of her femoropopliteal CTO lesions. She was referred to our hospital complaining of intermittent claudication in both legs. She had a long history of diabetes mellitus complicated with severe chronic kidney disease. Her estimated glomerular filtration rate was <20. She refused surgical revascularization; therefore, we performed our treatment without iodine contrast medium. First, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to confirm that the CTO lesions had caused severe claudication before intervention. Subsequently, the Outback Elite device and carbon dioxide (CO2) angiography made it possible to revascularize both of her legs without iodine contrast medium. At 6 months after the procedures, we did not observe exacerbation of claudication in her legs.
We report a case of postoperative life threatening metabolic acidosis in a young Type-2 diabetic woman who had no history of diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient underwent a non-complicated laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 6 days earlier. We discuss her clinical features, pathogenesis, management and outcome. We would like to make the surgical field aware of this potentially fatal diabetic complication since bariatric procedures are now indicated for the management of diabetic m'orbid obesity and Type-2 diabetes prevalence is on the rise, particularly in young individuals.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the most common cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Health screening is associated with higher outpatient visits for detection and treatment of CVD-related diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia). We examined the association between health screening, health utilization, and economic status.
To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a gestational diabetes (GDM) recall register on the long-term screening uptake postpartum and to evaluate the prevalence of prediabetes postpartum.
[This corrects the article on p. 106 in vol. 8, PMID: 28659865.].
The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid feedback control is a dynamic, adaptive system. In situations of illness and deprivation of energy representing type 1 allostasis, the stress response operates to alter both its set point and peripheral transfer parameters. In contrast, type 2 allostatic load, typically effective in psychosocial stress, pregnancy, metabolic syndrome, and adaptation to cold, produces a nearly opposite phenotype of predictive plasticity. The non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) or thyroid allostasis in critical illness, tumors, uremia, and starvation (TACITUS), commonly observed in hospitalized patients, displays a historically well-studied pattern of allostatic thyroid response. This is characterized by decreased total and free thyroid hormone concentrations and varying levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) ranging from decreased (in severe cases) to normal or even elevated (mainly in the recovery phase) TSH concentrations. An acute versus chronic stage (wasting syndrome) of TACITUS can be discerned. The two types differ in molecular mechanisms and prognosis. The acute adaptation of thyroid hormone metabolism to critical illness may prove beneficial to the organism, whereas the far more complex molecular alterations associated with chronic illness frequently lead to allostatic overload. The latter is associated with poor outcome, independently of the underlying disease. Adaptive responses of thyroid homeostasis extend to alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations during fetal life, periods of weight gain or loss, thermoregulation, physical exercise, and psychiatric diseases. The various forms of thyroid allostasis pose serious problems in differential diagnosis of thyroid disease. This review article provides an overview of physiological mechanisms as well as major diagnostic and therapeutic implications of thyroid allostasis under a variety of developmental and straining conditions.
While year after year, conditions, quality, and duration of human lives have been improving due to the progress in science, technology, education, and medicine, only eight diseases have been increasing in prevalence and shortening human lives because of premature deaths according to the retrospective official review on the state of US health, 1990-2010. These diseases are kidney cancer, chronic kidney diseases, liver cancer, diabetes, drug addiction, poisoning cases, consequences of falls, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as one of the leading pathologies. There are familial AD of hereditary nature (~4% of cases) and sporadic AD of unclear etiology (remaining ~96% of cases; i.e., non-familial AD). Therefore, sporadic AD is no longer a purely medical problem, but rather a social challenge when someone asks oneself: "What can I do in my own adulthood to reduce the risk of sporadic AD at my old age to save the years of my lifespan from the destruction caused by it?" Here, we combine two computational approaches for regulatory SNPs: Web service SNP_TATA_Comparator for sequence analysis and a PubMed-based keyword search for articles on the biochemical markers of diseases. Our purpose was to try to find answers to the question: "What can be done in adulthood to reduce the risk of sporadic AD in old age to prevent the lifespan reduction caused by it?" As a result, we found 89 candidate SNP markers of familial and sporadic AD (e.g., rs562962093 is associated with sporadic AD in the elderly as a complication of stroke in adulthood, where natural marine diets can reduce risks of both diseases in case of the minor allele of this SNP). In addition, rs768454929, and rs761695685 correlate with sporadic AD as a comorbidity of short stature, where maximizing stature in childhood and adolescence as an integral indicator of health can minimize (or even eliminate) the risk of sporadic AD in the elderly. After validation by clinical protocols, these candidate SNP markers may become interesting to the general population [may help to choose a lifestyle (in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood) that can reduce the risks of sporadic AD, its comorbidities, and complications in the elderly].
Sucralose is partially absorbed after oral ingestion, with the majority excreted in the feces. We aimed to measure plasma sucralose concentrations following ingestion of doses reflecting a range of consumption (from one can of diet soda up to multiple sodas over the course of a day) and to compare concentrations in children and adults. Eleven adults (7 females, 4 males) consumed 355 mL water containing 0 mg sucralose (control) or 68, 170, or 250 mg sucralose (equivalent to 1-4 diet sodas). A second group of adults (n=11, 6 females and 5 males) consumed 355 mL Diet Rite Cola� (68 mg sucralose and 41 mg acesulfame-potassium (ace-K)) or 68 mg sucralose and 41 mg ace-K in seltzer. Beverages were provided at separate visits in randomized order, prior to an oral glucose tolerance test. Eleven children (7 females and 4 males) consumed 0 or 68 mg sucralose in 240 mL water, in an identical study design. Blood was collected before beverage ingestion and serially for 120 min. Sucralose doses (corrected for weight) resulted in similar plasma concentrations in children and adults. Children reached peak concentrations of 145-400 ng/mL after 68 mg (mean 262.3 � 24.6 ng/mL). Most adults reached similar peak concentrations (200-400 ng/mL after 250 mg (365.6 � 69.9 ng/mL)) with the exception of two adults (1520 ng/mL and 1557 ng/mL, respectively). Concentrations were comparable whether sucralose was administered in water, combined with ace-K, or in diet soda. Due to their lower body weight and blood volume, children have markedly higher plasma sucralose concentrations after consumption of a typical diet soda, emphasizing the need to determine the clinical implications of sucralose use in children.
Metabolic function is regulated by the interplay of central and peripheral factors that ultimately regulate food intake and energy expenditure. The tachykinin substance P (SP) has been identified as a novel regulator of energy balance, however, the mechanisms underlying this effect are ill-defined and conflicting data regarding the role of SP on food intake have been reported by different groups.
Pancreatic islet transplantation is a promising therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes. However, the duration of long-term graft survival is limited due to inflammatory as well as non-inflammatory processes and routine clinical tests are not suitable to monitor islet survival. (111)In-exendin-SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) is a promising method to non-invasively image islets after transplantation and has the potential to help improve the clinical outcome. Whether (111)In-exendin-SPECT allows detecting small differences in beta-cell mass (BCM) and measuring the actual volume of islets that were successfully engrafted has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we evaluated the performance of (111)In-exendin-SPECT using an intramuscular islet transplantation model in C3H mice. In vivo imaging of animals transplanted with 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 islets revealed an excellent linear correlation between SPECT quantification of (111)In-exendin uptake and insulin-positive area of islet transplants, demonstrating that (111)In-exendin-SPECT specifically and accurately measures BCM. The high sensitivity of the method allowed measuring small differences in graft volumes, including grafts that contained less than 50 islets. The presented method is reliable, convenient and holds great potential for non-invasive monitoring of BCM after islet transplantation in humans.
We examined determinants of achieving blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and of treatment intensification in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP).
Suboptimal screening for diabetic eye disease is a major cause of preventable vision loss. Screening barriers include mydriasis and the extra time patients need to attend dedicated eye screening appointments. In the Clearsight trial, we are testing whether screening by non-mydriatic ultra-wide field (NM UWF) imaging on the day patients attend their diabetes outpatient clinic visit improves detection of clinically important eye disease compared with usual screening.
Excessive consumption of added sugars in the human diet has been associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary heart disease (CHD) and other elements of the metabolic syndrome. Recent studies have shown that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a critical pathway to metabolic syndrome. This model assesses the health and economic benefits of interventions aimed at reducing intake of added sugars.
In patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), emergency treatment like thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is complicated by insufficient availability of DOAC-specific coagulation tests. Conflicting recommendations have been published concerning the use of global coagulation assays for ruling out relevant DOAC-induced anticoagulation.
To investigate the relationship of hospital admissions due to unexplained syncope and orthostatic hypotension (OH) with subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality.
This study investigated the association between renal histology, as assessed by morphometric analysis using light (LM) and electron (EM) microscopy, and changes in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy.
Membrane contact sites (MCSs) function to facilitate the formation of membrane domains composed of specialized lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. In cells, membrane domains regulate membrane dynamics and biochemical and signaling pathways. We and others identified a highly conserved family of sterol transport proteins (Ltc/Lam) localized at diverse MCSs. In this study, we describe data indicating that the yeast family members Ltc1 and Ltc3/4 function at the vacuole and plasma membrane, respectively, to create membrane domains that partition upstream regulators of the TORC1 and TORC2 signaling pathways to coordinate cellular stress responses with sterol homeostasis.
Transthoracic (transapical and transaortic) access is inferior compared with femoral artery access. Percutaneous transcaval aortic access is a reasonable alternative approach that is being used in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with poor iliofemoral anatomy. Duplicated Inferior vena cava (DIVC) is an uncommon abnormality. We report the case of 76-year-old lady with history of severe peripheral vascular disease, morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and duplicated IVC that had severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. The patient had diffuse bilateral iliac disease precluding the arterial access required for TAVR. Other comorbidities made transthoracic access less desirable. We report the first successful Transcaval TAVR in a patient with DIVC.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells displaying the unique capability to activate na�ve T cells. DCs react to pathogen encounter also by the production of mediators of inflammation, including pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because of this complex role, any imbalance in DC function reflects into defective or exaggerated immune response and tissue damage. DCs comprise two main subsets, namely conventional or classical DCs (cDCs), that are dedicated antigen presenting cells, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), that respond to nucleic acids by releasing high amounts of type I interferons (IFNs). Since the formal demonstration that DC can prime autoreactive na�ve T cells, a full body of evidence has implicated DCs in virtually all manifestations of autoimmunity, although their exact pathogenic role often remains poorly characterized. The recent availability of progressively more refined strategies of constitutive and inducible DC ablation is contributing in defining the precise role of DCs at least in some autoimmune disease models. This review aims at critically summarizing the current literature concerning selected aspects of DC biology that, when altered, facilitate autoimmunity. These aspects include: i) mechanisms of tissue entry and accumulation, ii) mechanisms of activation and iii) orchestration of the immune balance by cytokine production. A special focus will be on inappropriate DC activation by signals released by damaged tissues via innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors. These signals are responsible, in pDCs, for exaggerated type I IFN production, the hallmark of a set of apparently distant autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and type 1 diabetes; whereas in cDCs, they trigger DC rapid maturation and Th1/Th17 cytokine secretion. Tissue-derived molecules also contribute to further promote tissue damage and autoantigen spreading, possibly through pDC-derived Granzyme B secretion. Finally, the therapeutic possibilities based on DC targeting in human autoimmune diseases will be briefly summarized.
Actually, pilon fractures are classified according to AO and Ruedi Allgower classification systems based on X-rays. These classifications are less reproducible and do not provide necessary information for proper surgical planning. Aim of the study is to (1) propose a new classification system based on CT scan; (2) to check the prognostic value of this classification and (3) to evaluate its reliability and (4) reproducibility. We retrospectively reviewed 71 cases of pilon fracture. All fractures were classified according to AO, Ruedi Allgower and new proposed classification system by 5 surgeons. Clinical and radiographic evaluation were performed at a mean follow-up of 36 months. Cohen's K value was calculated in order to evaluate the interobserver and intraobserver agreement. Sixty-four of 71 fractures healed. Average AOFAS score was 91,7�7,8 in the Type I of new classification proposed, 87,7�7,8 in the Type II, 82�18,6 in type III, and 67,2�20,9 in type IV. Using the AO classification system the average K weighted value among the five reviewers was 0,51; using Ruedi Allgower classification it was 0,50 and using the new classification system it was 0,88 (p<0.0005). This study demonstrated that the new classification system is prognostic, reliable and reproducible. Moreover it provides a new treatment-oriented classification for this challenging fracture which affect the quality of life of the patients more than chronic diseases like diabetes and coronaropathy or pelvic fractures.
More than 1�6 million people are estimated to die of fungal diseases each year, and about a billion people have cutaneous fungal infections. Fungal disease diagnosis requires a high level of clinical suspicion and specialised laboratory testing, in addition to culture, histopathology, and imaging expertise. Physicians with varied specialist training might see patients with fungal disease, yet it might remain unrecognised. Antifungal treatment is more complex than treatment for bacterial or most viral infections, and drug interactions are particularly problematic. Health systems linking diagnostic facilities with therapeutic expertise are typically fragmented, with major elements missing in thousands of secondary care and hospital settings globally. In this paper, the last in a Series of eight papers, we describe these limitations and share responses involving a combined health systems and public health framework illustrated through country examples from Mozambique, Kenya, India, and South Africa. We suggest a mainstreaming approach including greater integration of fungal diseases into existing HIV infection, tuberculosis infection, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and blindness health programmes; provision of enhanced laboratory capacity to detect fungal diseases with associated surveillance systems; procurement and distribution of low-cost, high-quality antifungal medicines; and concomitant integration of fungal disease into training of the health workforce.
The study was designed to investigate whether the hamilton rating scale for depression (24-items) (HAM-D24) can be used to predict the diabetic microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. 288 hospitalized patients with T2DM were enrolled. Their diabetic microvascular complications including diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy and diabetic foot as well as demographic, clinical data, blood samples and echocardiography were documented. All the enrolled patients received HAM-D24 evaluation. The HAM-D24 score and incidence of depression in T2DM patients with each diabetic microvascular complication were significantly higher than those in T2DM patients without each diabetic microvascular complication. After the adjustment of use of insulin and hypoglycemic drug, duration of T2DM, mean platelet volume, creatinine, albumin, fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin type A1C, left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively, HAM-D24 score was still significantly associated with diabetic microvascular complications (OR = 1.188-1.281, all P < 0.001). The AUC of HAM-D24 score for the prediction of diabetic microvascular complication was 0.832 (0.761-0.902). 15 points of HAM-D24 score was considered as the optimal cutoff with the sensitivity of 0.778 and specificity of 0.785. In summary, HAM-D24 score may be used as a novel predictor of diabetic microvascular complications in T2DM patients.
Latinos are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Identifying behavioral factors associated with CVD risk in this population may provide novel targets for further research to reduce chronic disease disparities. Dysfunctional eating patterns (emotional eating [EE], uncontrolled eating [UE], and cognitive restraint of eating [CR]) may be associated with CVD risk but little is known about this relationship in Latinos.
Apolipoproteins B (apoB) and A1 (apoA1) are major protein constituents of low-density and high-density lipoproteins, respectively, and serum concentrations of these apolipoproteins are associated with risk of atherosclerosis. Vitamin A (VA) has been implicated in lipoprotein metabolism. We evaluated the associations of serum apoB, apoA1 and their ratio (apoBAR) with risk of incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the possible modification by serum VA.
Clinical trials are essential tools for the progress of clinical medicine in its diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Since the first trial in 1948, which related tobacco use with lung cancer, there have been more than 150,000 clinical trials to date in various areas (paediatrics, cardiology, oncology, endocrinology, etc.). This article highlights the importance for all physicians to participate, over the course of their professional career, in a clinical trial, due to the inherent benefits for patients, the progress of medicine and for curricular prestige. The authors have created a synthesis of their experience with clinical trials on hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and ischaemic heart disease over the course of almost 3 decades. Furthermore, a brief reference has been made to the characteristics of a phase I unit, as well as to a number of research studies currently underway.
In humans, hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection only occurs in the presence of a concomitant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and induces the most severe form of human viral hepatitis. Even though HDV is spread worldwide and is endemic in some regions, screening and treatment has been often neglected in part due to the lack of an effective therapy. Moreover, HDV prevalence rates are increasing in many countries driven by immigration from areas of high endemicity. Currently, no FDA-approved anti-HDV therapy is available, although interferon (IFN) alpha therapy has demonstrated benefit in a minority of patients. In this review, we present a current view of our understanding of the epidemiology, molecular virology and management of HDV infection. We additionally discuss new treatment approaches in development and describe the most promising results of recent and ongoing clinical trials of these new potential agents.
The objective was to evaluate cost-utility of bariatric surgery in Germany for a lifetime and 10-year horizon from a health care payer perspective.
Neovascularization is impaired in diabetes mellitus, which leads to the development of peripheral arterial disease and is mainly attributed to the dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Previous studies proved the promotional effect of curcumin on neovascularization in wound healing of diabetes. Thus, we hypothesize that curcumin could promote neovascularization at sites of hindlimb ischemia in diabetes and might take effect via modulating the function of EPCs.
Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates protective pathways to counteract hypoxia and prevent tissue damage in conjunction with renal injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate a role of HIF-1 in diabetes-induced kidney damage.
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) in young adults poses significant cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk for later years. Parental history of CVDs is known to affect the prevalence of CVD risk in adulthood. In sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of MetS in young adults and its relationship with parental CVDs is largely unknown. We studied the gender-specific prevalence of MetS and its association with parental history of diabetes, hypertension and CVDs in young adults resident in urban Ghana.
Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have high rates of gestational and pre-existing type 2 diabetes in pregnancy. The Northern Territory (NT) Diabetes in Pregnancy Partnership was established to enhance systems and services to improve health outcomes. It has three arms: a clinical register, developing models of care and a longitudinal birth cohort. This study used a process evaluation to report on health professional's perceptions of models of care and related quality improvement activities since the implementation of the Partnership.
The purpose of this study is to understand health care provider barriers to referring patients to Medical Fitness Center Facilities within an affiliated teaching hospital system using referral of diabetic services as an example. The aims of this study include: (1) to assess health care providers' awareness and use of facilities, (2) to determine barriers to referring patients to facilities, (3) identify current and needed resources and/or changes to increase referral to facilities.
To investigate whether poor glycemic control status has a negative impact on survival outcomes and tumor response to chemotherapy in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC).
Human polymorphisms with derived alleles that are protective against disease may provide powerful translational opportunities. Here we report a method to identify such candidate polymorphisms and apply it to common non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) associated with common diseases. Our study also sought to establish which of the identified protective nsSNPs show evidence of positive selection, taking this as indirect evidence that the protective variant has a beneficial effect on phenotype. Further, we performed an analysis to quantify the predicted effect of each protective variant on protein function/structure.
Illness perceptions involve the personal beliefs that patients have about their illness and may influence health behaviours considerably. Since an instrument to measure these perceptions for Malay population in Malaysia is lacking, we translated and examined the psychometric properties of the Malay version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (MBIPQ) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sleep duration and glycemic control in adult Hispanic patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Methods This cross-sectional study used baseline data from 317 Hispanic adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who participated in a randomized controlled trial testing a peer support intervention to improve diabetes control. To be eligible, participants had to be 18 years or older and have A1C >7% in the 3 months prior to randomization. Glycemic control was assessed by A1C ascertained through medical chart review; higher A1C levels reflected poorer glycemic control. Sleep duration (hours/night), diabetes control behaviors, and demographics were obtained by interviewer-administered questionnaire. We used multivariable generalized linear models to estimate the association between sleep duration and glycemic control. Results Forty-three percent of participants reported sleeping fewer than 7 hours per night. Sleep duration (hours/night) was inversely associated with A1C levels; however, the relationship was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for insulin status. Conclusions Sleep duration was not significantly associated with glycemic control in this sample of Hispanic adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes when adjusting for insulin. Future research should continue to explore this relationship among Hispanic adults with diabetes using an objective measure of sleep duration and a larger sample of Hispanic adults with both controlled and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes to determine if these results hold true.
The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes, and identify predictors thereof, after fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease in a series of diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic patients.
Vitamin D deficiency is common among immigrants in the Nordic region. It may lead to osteomalacia with severe musculoskeletal pain. There are reports�that vitamin D deficiency without osteomalacia may lead to pain but little is known of the effect of treatment.
This article examines how a 6-week mental health resilience course for people with long-term conditions (LTCs; diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis) increased perceived resilience of older participants. This article examines how peer support assisted participants to develop resilience, considers gender issues, examines the importance of course activities, and explores how resilience enhances quality of life. A mixed methods approach was used. A before-and-after questionnaire was administered 3 times, including 3-month follow-up. Interviews were held with 24 program participants, aged 45 to 80 years. Diaries were kept by participants over 3 months. Survey findings showed significant gains in perceived resilience, at the end of the course, with no significant drop-off after 3 months. Interview and diary narratives highlighted positive experiences around well-being, condition management, and social engagement. Peer support was key to effective processes. Challenges concern ongoing support in communities, and considering age and gender variables when researching what improved resilience means to older people with LTCs.
With the discovery of insulin nearly a century ago, the diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) transformed from a death sentence to a chronic medical condition. Despite the advances that have been made, the vast majority of those living with T1D still struggle to achieve targeted control. Yet, a plethora of agents have been developed to treat those with Type 2 Diabetes. Exploration of how these agents may benefit those with T1D has been an area of intense investigation, especially due to the overweight/obesity epidemic, which now afflicts more than 60% of those living with T1D. Areas covered: This review focuses on agents that have been utilized, including inhaled insulin preparations, pramlintide, metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and dual SGLT1/2 inhibitors. Furthermore, with approval of the first hybrid closed loop (CL) system, the development of dual hormone CL systems is being explored. While the most common agent applied to these dual systems has been glucagon, research has been conducted to assess how some of the adjunctive therapies described above could aide with achieving postprandial glucose control while on CL insulin delivery. Expert opinion: By becoming less insulin-centric and incorporating some of these other agents, it is possible we may be able to better combat T1D.
There is a pressing need for long-term, controlled drug release for sustained treatment of chronic or persistent medical conditions and diseases. Guided drug delivery is difficult because therapeutic compounds need to survive numerous transport barriers and binding targets throughout the body. Nanoscale protein-based polymers are increasingly used for drug and vaccine delivery to cross these biological barriers and through blood circulation to their molecular site of action. Protein-based polymers compared to synthetic polymers have the advantages of good biocompatibility, biodegradability, environmental sustainability, cost effectiveness and availability. This review addresses the sources of protein-based polymers, compares the similarity and differences, and highlights characteristic properties and functionality of these protein materials for sustained and controlled drug release. Targeted drug delivery using highly functional multicomponent protein composites to guide active drugs to the site of interest will also be discussed. A systematical elucidation of drug-delivery efficiency in the case of molecular weight, particle size, shape, morphology, and porosity of materials will then be demonstrated to achieve increased drug absorption. Finally, several important biomedical applications of protein-based materials with drug-delivery function-including bone healing, antibiotic release, wound healing, and corneal regeneration, as well as diabetes, neuroinflammation and cancer treatments-are summarized at the end of this review.
In recent years, glucose-sensitive drug delivery systems have attracted considerable attention in the treatment of diabetes. These systems can regulate payload release by the changes of blood glucose levels continuously and automatically with potential application in self-regulated drug delivery. Boronic acid (BA), especially phenylboronic acid (PBA), as glucose-sensitive agent has been the focus of research in the design of glucose-sensitive platforms. This article reviews the previous attempts at the developments of PBA-based glucose-sensitive drug delivery systems regarding the PBA-functionalized materials and glucose-triggered drug delivery. The obstacles and potential developments of glucose-sensitive drug delivery systems based on PBA for diabetes treatment in the future are also described. The PBA-functionalized platforms that regulate drug delivery induced by glucose are expected to contribute significantly to the design and development of advanced intelligent self-regulated drug delivery systems for treatment of diabetes.
Patients with diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of dental implant failure. One major cause is high-glucose induced oxidative stress. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a naturally occurring compound and dietary supplement, has been established as a potent antioxidant that is a strong scavenger of free radicals. However, few studies have yet investigated the effect of ALA on osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts cultured with high glucose medium. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of ALA on the osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells under high glucose condition.
Glucagon has plenty of effects via a specific glucagon receptor(GCGR) like elevating the blood glucose, improving fatty acids metabolism, energy expenditure and increasing lipolysis in adipose tissue. The most important role of glucagon is to regulate the blood glucose, but the emergent possibilities of hyperglycaemia is exist. Glucagon could also slightly activate glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor(GLP-1R), which lead to blood glucose lowering effect. This study aims to erase the likelihood of hyperglycaemia and to remain the inherent catabolic effects through improving GLP-1R activation and deteriorating GCGR activation so as to lower the bodyweight and show diabetes-protective effects. Firstly, twelve cysteine modified GLP-1/GCGR dual agonists were synthesized (1-12). Then, the GLP-1R/GCGR mediated activation and biological activity in normal ICR mice were comprehensively performed. Compounds substituted by cysteine at positions 22, 23 and 25 in glucagon were observed to be better regulators of the body weight and blood glucose. To prolong the half-lives of derivatives, various fatty side chain maleimides were modified to optimal glucagon analogues. Laurate maleimide conjugate 4d was the most potent. Administration of 1000�nmol/kg 4d once every two days for a month normalized adiposity and glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Improvements in plasma metabolic parameters including insulin, leptin, and adiponectin were observed. These studies suggest that compound 4d behaves well in lowering body weight and maintaining energy expenditure without a chance of hyperglycaemia, 4d has strong clinical potential as an efficient GLP-1/GCGR agonist in the prevention and treatment of obesity and dyslipidemia.
We studied the effects of minocycline (an inhibitor of microglial activation) on the expression and activity of Notch-1 receptor, and explored the therapeutic efficacy of minocycline combined with Notch inhibitor DAPT in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP). Diabetic rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection (ip) of Streptozotocin (STZ). Expression and activity of Notch-1 and expression of macrophage/microglia marker Iba-1 were detected by WB. Diabetes induction significantly attenuated sciatic nerve conduction velocity, and dramatically augmented the expression and the activity of Notch-1 in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord. Minocycline treatment, however, accelerated the decreased conduction velocity of sciatic nerve and suppressed Notch-1expression and activity in diabetic rats. Similar to DAPT treatment, minocycline administration also prolonged thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) and increase mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) in diabetic rats in response to heat or mechanical stimulation via inhibition the expression and the activity of Notch-1 in spinal cord. Combination of DAPT and minocycline further inhibited Notch-1 receptor signaling and reduce neuropathic pain exhibited as improved TWL and MWT. Our study revealed a novel mechanism of Notch-1 receptor inhibition in spinal cord induced by minocycline administration, and suggested that the combination of minocycline and DAPT has the potential to treat DNP.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the enzymatic activity of the purinergic system in sera samples from alloxan-induced diabetic mice treated with tucum� oil (Astrocaryum vulgare). For this, the mice were divided into four groups (n=6): control/water (the group CW); control/tucum� oil (the group CT); diabetic/water (the group DW), and diabetic/tucum� oil (the group DT) treated for 14days with 5.0mLkg(-1) via oral gavage. On day 14 post-treatment, mice were submitted to euthanasia and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture. Tucum� oil treatment significantly decreased (p<0.05) blood glucose levels in the group DT compared to the group DW. These results demonstrated an increase (p<0.05) in NTPDase (adenosine triphosphate (ATP substrate) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP substrate)), 5'-nucleotidase (AMP substrate) and adenosine deaminase (ADA; adenosine substrate) activities in serum from the group DW compared to the group CW. Tucum� oil treatment prevented these alterations in the group DT compared to the group DW, and restored these parameters near to the group CW. In summary, the treatment with tucum� oil was able to modulate the alterations caused by hyperglycemia probably by the presence of carotenoids compounds, maintaining normal levels of ATP, ADP, AMP and adenosine, molecules that could exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, depending on their concentration. Thus, the tucum� oil is a promising natural compound with protective action against diabetes and its side effects, such as changes in the purinergic system, improving the immune system.
Thyroid cancer is the fastest increasing cancer in the U.S., and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounts for >80% of incident cases. Increasing exposure to flame retardant chemicals (FRs) has raised concerns about their possible role in this 'epidemic'. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that higher exposure to FRs is associated with increased odds of PTC.
Hypercholesterolemia confers susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both serum total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) exhibit a strong genetic component (heritability estimates 0.41-0.50). However, a large part of this heritability cannot be explained by the variants identified in recent extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on lipids. Our aim was to find genetic causes leading to high LDL-C levels and ultimately CVD in a large Austrian family presenting with what appears to be autosomal dominant inheritance for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
Diabetic patients may find it difficult to achieve recommended nutrient intakes embedded within dietary guidelines. The objective of this analysis was to document total sodium, saturated fat and added sugar intake as well as the main food sources of these nutrients in Canadian adults with type 2 diabetes before and after an intervention focused on healthy eating. Participants were enrolled in a single-arm dietary intervention trial designed to improve glycemic control and adherence to dietary recommendations. A 4-week menu plan and recipes was provided for participants along with a 6-week educational curriculum. Three repeated 24-hour dietary recalls were collected at baseline and 3 months. Food sources of sodium, saturated fat and added sugar were a secondary outcome derived from the dietary recalls. After 3 months, there was a reduction (p<0.05) in sodium intake of 561 mg/day, mainly due to reduced consumption of processed meats, soups and condiments. Significantly lower intake of processed meat contributed to -2.9 g/day saturated fat intake (p<0.1) while added sugar intake declined by 7 g/day (p<0.1), due to lower consumption of baked goods/desserts and chocolate (both p<0.05). The intervention was beneficial for type 2 diabetes patients in terms of changing dietary habits. However, the majority of the participants still exceeded the dietary guidelines for sodium and saturated fat. In addition to the efforts of individuals and their healthcare providers, strategies to increase the nutritional quality of prepared foods could provide widespread benefits.
To determine if varus thrust, bowing-out of the knee during gait, i.e., the first appearance or worsening of varus alignment during stance, is associated with incident and progressive knee osteoarthritis (OA), we undertook an Osteoarthritis Initiative ancillary study. We further considered hypothesized associations adjusted for static alignment, anticipating some attenuation.

The National Diabetes Education Program created the Small Steps. Big Rewards. GAME PLAN. toolkit to deliver basic type 2 diabetes prevention information to individuals at risk. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of GAME PLAN on diabetes prevention knowledge and behavioral readiness in the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study and participant satisfaction with toolkit materials.
European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging/Heart Failure Association Cardiac Oncology Toxicity Registry was launched in October 2014 as a European Society of Cardiology multicentre registry of breast cancer patients referred to imaging laboratories for routine surveillance, suspected, or confirmed anticancer drug-related cardiotoxicity (ADRC). After a pilot phase (1�year recruitment and 1�year follow-up), some changes have been made to the protocol (version 1.0) and electronic case report form.
This project was designed to increase family practice clinicians' adherence to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (2013) and American Diabetes Association (ADA, 2016) clinical practice guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 40- to 75-year-old adults with type II diabetes (DMII) through interactive education, an electronic alert, and quality improvement sessions on the treatment and management of cholesterol in a family practice primary care setting.
Cardiovascular safety alerts about rosiglitazone resulted in regulatory actions in several countries in 2010, but the Food and Drug Administration eliminated access restrictions in 2013, reflecting new evidence concerning the drug safety. We investigated the effects of safety signals and regulation shifts concerning rosiglitazone on prescribing of antidiabetic drugs (ADs).
To compare the sodium glucose-cotransporter-2-inhibitor (SGLT-2i) dapagliflozin versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) regarding risk associations of MACE (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or cardiovascular [CV] mortality), hospital events for heart failure (HHF), atrial fibrillation, and severe hypoglycemia for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients in a real-world setting.
Glucocorticoids are widely used as therapeutic agents to treat immune-mediated diseases in humans because of their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. However, glucocorticoids have various adverse effects, in particular rapid and pronounced bone loss associated with fractures in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, a common form of secondary osteoporosis. In zebrafish, which are increasingly used to study processes of bone regeneration and disease, glucocorticoids show detrimental effects on bone tissue; however, the underlying cellular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that treatment with the glucocorticoid prednisolone impacts on the number, activity and differentiation of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and immune cells during ontogenetic growth, homeostasis and regeneration of zebrafish bone. Macrophage numbers are reduced in both larval and adult tissues, correlating with decreased generation of myelomonocytes and enhanced apoptosis of these cells. In contrast, osteoblasts fail to proliferate, show decreased activity and undergo incomplete differentiation. In addition, prednisolone treatment mitigates the number and recruitment of osteoclasts to sites of bone regeneration in adult fish. In combination, these effects delay bone growth and impair bone regeneration. Our study demonstrates the many-faceted effects of glucocorticoids in non-mammalian vertebrates and helps to further establish the zebrafish as a model to study glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

Financial hardship may affect up to 30% of cancer survivors, however, little research has addressed the effect of employment change on financial hardship. This study compared the self-reported financial hardship of middle-aged (45-64�years) colorectal cancer survivors (n�=�187) at 6 and 12�months following diagnosis with that of a matched general population group (n�=�355). Colorectal cancer survivors were recruited through the Queensland Cancer Registry, Australia; data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey were used for the general population group. Pearson chi-square tests were used to assess the differences in proportions between the two groups and McNemar tests to assess differences across time among the same group. Generalised linear modelling was performed to produce prevalence ratios. A higher proportion of workers with colorectal cancer reported financial strain (money shortage for living essentials) at 6�months (15%) but eased and was comparable to the comparison group at 12�months (7%). Middle-aged working cancer survivors who ceased or reduced work were more likely to report not being financially comfortable, compared with those who had continued work (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.66, 95%CI: 1.12, 2.44) at 12�months. Health professionals, employers and government services should address the impact of impaired employment on financial hardship among cancer survivors.
To examine how the social determinants of health have been considered in conceptualizations of multimorbidity in older adults in the literature and to identify implications for nursing practice, research and health-care planning and policy.
The purpose of this study was to determine the structural validity of the Health Literacy Scale (HLS) in Korean patients with diabetes based on the previously reported first-order three-factor and two-factor models and a newly proposed second-order model, to identify which model best represents the structure of the Korean version of the HLS (HLS-K).
To investigate the risk of vertigo in patients with sleep apnea.
Inflammation can promote the development of arthritis, obesity, cardiovascular, type II diabetes, pancreatitis, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, and certain types of cancer. Compounds isolated from plants have been practiced since ancient times for curing various ailments including inflammatory disorders and to support normal physiological functions. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a yellow coloring agent, extracted from turmeric that has been used for the prevention and treatment of various inflammatory diseases. Numerous studies have shown that curcumin modulate multiple molecular targets and can be translated to the clinics for multiple therapeutic processes. There is compelling evidence that curcumin can block cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis as well as reduced the prolonged survival of cancer cells. Curcumin mediates anti-inflammatory effect through downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, transcription factors, protein kinases, and enzymes that promote inflammation and development of chronic diseases. In addition, curcumin induces apoptosis through mitochondrial and receptor-mediated pathways by activating caspase cascades. Curcumin is a safe and nontoxic drug that has been reported to be well tolerated. Available clinical trials support the potential role of curcumin for treatment of various inflammatory disorders. However, curcumin's efficacy is hindered by poor absorption and low bioavailability, which limit its translation into clinics.�This review outlines the potential pharmacological and clinical role of curcumin, which provide a gateway for the beneficial role of plant isolated compounds in treatment of various inflammatory diseases and cancer.
Renal denervation is facing various challenges to its initial claimed value in hypertension treatment. Major concerns are the choice of the patients and the technical efficacy of the renal denervation. Different factors have been described as predicting the capacity of renal denervation to decrease blood pressure. These factors are related to the patients, the procedure and the tools to confirm successful neural ablation. Their use in future trials should help to improve renal denervation trials understanding and outcomes. This review summarizes the different predictive factors available and their potential benefits in patient selection and in procedure guidance. This article is protected by copyright.

During the last decade, the obesity pandemia has skyrocketed, and the spectre is threatening children, adolescents and lower income families worldwide. Although driven by an increase in the consumption of ultra-processed edibles of poor nutritional value, the obesogenic changes in contemporary human lifestyle affect people differently, revealing that some individuals are more prone to developing increased adiposity. During the last years, we performed a variety of genetic, evolutionary, biochemical and behavioral experiments that allowed us to understand how a group of neurons present in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus regulate the expression of the proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) gene and induce satiety. We disentangled the neuronal transcriptional code of Pomc by identifying the cis-acting regulatory elements and primary transcription factors controlling hypothalamic Pomc expression and determined their functional importance in the regulation of food intake and adiposity. Altogether, our studies reviewed here shed light on the power and limitations of the mammalian central satiety pathways and may contribute to the development of individual and collective strategies to reduce the debilitating effects of the self-induced obesity pandemia.

The incidence of pyogenic liver abscess in Taiwan appears to be much higher than that in western countries. However, little is known about the incidence of pyogenic liver abscess among patients with predialysis chronic kidney disease. The objective of this study was to assess the association between predialysis chronic kidney disease and the risk of pyogenic liver abscess in Taiwan.
Diabetes is a risk factor for the development of cognitive impairment and possibly for accelerated progression to Alzheimer disease (AD) and other dementias, though the trajectory of cognitive decline in general and in specfic cognitive domains by diabetes is unclear.
This study examines prehospital Emergency Medical Service (EMS) utilisation and patterns of demand for hyperglycaemia management, including characteristics of individuals and factors related to hospital transport.
To determine factors associated with differential changes in body fat, insulin resistance and aerobic capacity following a 12-week exercise intervention in overweight and obese women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors are used worldwide in the management of diabetes, but their role in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disorders has yet to be defined. We found that linagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, suppressed capillary rarefaction in the hearts of mice with dietary obesity. Metabolomic analysis performed with capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) showed that linagliptin promoted favorable metabolic remodeling in cardiac tissue, which was characterized by high levels of citrulline and creatine. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the cardiac tissue level of early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1), which activates angiogenesis, was significantly reduced in untreated mice with dietary obesity, while this decrease was inhibited by administration of linagliptin. Mature fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) has a putative truncation site for DPP-4 at the NH2-terminal, and LC-MS/MS showed that recombinant DPP-4 protein cleaved the NH2-terminal dipeptides of mature FGF-2. Incubation of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with FGF-2 increased Egr1 expression, while it was suppressed by recombinant DPP-4 protein. Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor-A had a critical role in mediating FGF-2/EGR-1 signaling. In conclusion, pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 suppressed capillary rarefaction and contributed to favorable remodeling of cardiac metabolism in mice with dietary obesity.
The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy and safety of glyburide as a treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to insulin.
To estimate the association between a history of periodontitis (PD) and the risk of incident palindromic rheumatism (PR).
Microbes, including viruses, influence type 1 diabetes (T1D) development, but many such influences remain undefined. Previous work on underlying immune mechanisms has focussed on cytokines and T cells. Here, we compared two nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse colonies, NODlow and NODhigh, differing markedly in their cumulative T1D incidence (22% vs. 90% by 30 weeks in females). NODhigh mice harbored more complex intestinal microbiota, including several pathobionts; both colonies harbored segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), thought to suppress T1D. Young NODhigh females had increased B-cell activation in their mesenteric lymph nodes. These phenotypes were transmissible. Co-housing of NODlow with NODhigh mice after weaning did not change T1D development, but T1D incidence was increased in female offspring of co-housed NODlow mice, which were exposed to the NODhigh environment both before and after weaning. These offspring also acquired microbiota and B-cell activation approaching those of NODhigh mice. In NODlow females, the low rate of T1D was unaffected by cyclophosphamide but increased by PD-L1 blockade. Thus, environmental exposures that are innocuous later in life may promote T1D progression if acquired early during immune development, possibly by altering B-cell activation and/or PD-L1 function. Moreover, T1D suppression in NOD mice by SFB may depend on the presence of other microbial influences. The complexity of microbial immune regulation revealed in this murine model may also be relevant to the environmental regulation of human T1D.
To investigate the association between spouse weekly working hours (SWWH) and the estimated 10-years risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
In older adults (aged 70-74 years), African-Americans have 4-fold higher risk of developing hypertension-attributed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than European-Americans. A hypothesized mechanism linking hypertension and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the innate immune response and inflammation. Persons with CKD are also more susceptible to infection. Gene expression in peripheral blood can provide a view of the innate immune activation profile. We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes, microRNAs, and pathways in peripheral blood between cases with CKD and high blood pressure under hypertension treatment versus controls without CKD and with controlled blood pressure in African Americans.
Current data highlight the pathological aspects of excess aldosterone in promoting glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria in diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

Living with type 1 diabetes, especially in developing countries, can feel overwhelming for parents and children because constant vigilance is required for proper care with an inadequacy of resources. Our aim was to investigate the frequency and risk factors of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
Identifying patient groups with low participation in diabetes self-management education can inform efforts to improve its use. Data from the 2013-2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to assess variation in participation in a diabetes self-management class in New Jersey. Nonparticipation varied significantly by race/ethnicity (P < .001), education (P < .001), health care coverage (P = .04), county (P < .001), years since diagnosis (P < .001), and whether a diabetes provider visit occurred in the past year (P = .002). Attention is warranted in identifying participation barriers among patients who live in certain counties, have less education, are without health care coverage, have been diagnosed with diabetes more recently, visit a provider less often, or belong to certain racial/ethnic minority groups.
Glycemic fluctuations, characterized by short-term oscillations in plasma glucose, are important when managing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and may be considered a target of glucose-lowering therapies. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been used to evaluate the effects of different treatments on glycemic fluctuations. This review examines approaches to and the importance of minimizing glycemic fluctuations among patients with T2D. Measures of HbA1c, fructosamine, and glycated albumin reflect a long-term average of plasma glucose, and are therefore unable to provide an accurate measure of short-term glycemic oscillations. CGM provides accurate monitoring of real-time glucose fluctuations and has been used to investigate the effects of lifestyle and treatment on daily glycemic control. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have demonstrated significant improvements in measures such as the mean amplitude of glucose excursions and standard deviation of CGM. Case studies of two patients with T2D utilizing CGM are also included in this review, which demonstrated that CGM was a useful tool for diagnosing unrecognized hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in situations in which it was impractical to check fingerstick concentrations. Altogether, the evidence suggests that glycemic fluctuations are a potential target to consider when managing T2D. CGM allows for the real-time evaluation of glycemic fluctuations and may assist in the development of an individualized treatment plan to adequately control short-term oscillations in blood glucose levels.
Insulin is a miraculous hormone that has served a seminal role in the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes for nearly a century. Insulin resides within in a superfamily of structurally related peptides that are distinguished by three invariant disulfide bonds that anchor the three-dimensional conformation of the hormone. The additional family members include the insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and the relaxin-related set of peptides that includes the so-called insulin-like peptides. Advances in peptide chemistry and rDNA-based synthesis have enabled the preparation of multiple insulin analogues. The translation of these methods from insulin to related peptides has presented unique challenges that pertain to differing biophysical properties and unique amino acid compositions. This Account presents a historical context for the advances in the chemical synthesis of insulin and the related peptides, with division into two general categories where disulfide bond formation is facilitated by native conformational folding or alternatively orthogonal chemical reactivity. The inherent differences in biophysical properties of insulin-like peptides, and in particular within synthetic intermediates, have constituted a central limitation to achieving high yield synthesis of properly folded peptides. Various synthetic approaches have been advanced in the past decade to successfully address this challenge. The use of chemical ligation and metastable amide bond surrogates are two of the more important synthetic advances in the preparation of high quality synthetic precursors to high potency peptides. The discovery and application of biomimetic connecting peptides simplifies proper disulfide formation and the subsequent traceless removal by chemical methods dramatically simplifies the total synthesis of virtually any two-chain insulin-like peptide. We report the application of these higher synthetic yield methodologies to the preparation of insulin-like peptides in support of exploratory in vivo studies requiring a large quantity of peptide. Tangentially, we demonstrate the use of these methods to study the relative importance of the IGF-1 connecting peptide to its biological activity. We report the translation of these finding in search of an insulin analog that might be comparably enhanced by a suitable connecting peptide for interaction with the insulin receptor, as occurs with IGF-1 and its receptor. The results identify a unique receptor site in the IGF-1 receptor from which this enhancement derives. The selective substitution of this specific IGF-1 receptor sequence into the homologous site in the insulin receptor generated a chimeric receptor that was equally capable of signaling with insulin or IGF-1. This novel receptor proved to enhance the potency of lower affinity insulin ligands when they were supplemented with the IGF-1 connecting peptide that similarly enhanced IGF-1 activity at its receptor. The chimeric insulin receptor demonstrated no further enhancement of potency for native insulin when it was similarly prepared as a single-chain analogue with a native IGF-1 connecting peptide. These results suggest a more highly evolved insulin receptor structure where the requirement for an additional structural element to achieve high potency interaction as demonstrated for IGF-1 is no longer required.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy. Although GDM usually resolves following birth, it is associated with significant morbidities for mothers and their infants in the short and long term. There is strong evidence to support treatment for GDM. However, there is uncertainty as to whether or not screening all pregnant women for GDM will improve maternal and infant health and if so, the most appropriate setting for screening. This review updates a Cochrane Review, first published in 2010, and subsequently updated in 2014.
Increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote platelet activation. The sources of platelet-derived ROS are diverse and whether or not mitochondrial derived ROS, modulates platelet function is incompletely understood. Studies of platelets from patients with sickle cell disease, and diabetes suggest a correlation between mitochondrial ROS and platelet dysfunction. Therefore, we generated mice with a platelet specific knockout of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2-KO) to determine if increased mitochondrial ROS increases platelet activation. SOD2-KO platelets demonstrated decreased SOD2 activity and increased mitochondrial ROS, however total platelet ROS was unchanged. Mitochondrial function and content were maintained in non-stimulated platelets. However SOD2-KO platelets demonstrated decreased mitochondrial function following thrombin stimulation. In vitro platelet activation and spreading was normal and in vivo, deletion of SOD2 did not change tail-bleeding or arterial thrombosis indices. In pathophysiological models mediated by platelet-dependent immune mechanisms such as sepsis and autoimmune inflammatory arthritis, SOD2-KO mice were phenotypically identical to wildtype controls. These data demonstrate that increased mitochondrial ROS does not result in platelet dysfunction.
In the last years, autophagy has been revealed as an essential pathway for multiple biological processes and physiological functions. As a catabolic route, autophagy regulation by nutrient availability has been evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. On one hand, autophagy induction by starvation is associated with a significant loss in body weight in mice. Here, we demonstrate that both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the autophagy process compromise weight loss induced by starvation. Moreover, autophagic potential also impacts on weight gain induced by distinct hypercaloric regimens. Atg4b-deficient mice, which show limited autophagic competence, exhibit a major increase in body weight in response to distinct obesity-associated metabolic challenges. This response is characterized by the presence of larger adipocytes in visceral fat tissue, increased hepatic steatosis, as well as reduced glucose tolerance and attenuated insulin responses. Similarly, autophagy-deficient mice are more vulnerable to experimentally induced type-I diabetes, showing an increased susceptibility to acute streptozotocin administration. Notably, pharmacological stimulation of autophagy in wild-type mice by spermidine reduced both weight gain and obesity-associated alterations upon hypercaloric regimens. Altogether, these results indicate that systemic autophagic activity influences the resilience of the organism to weight gain induced by high-calorie diets, as well as to the obesity-associated features of both type-1 and type-2 diabetes.
A cohort of 50-year-olds from Canterbury, New Zealand (N = 404), representative of midlife adults, undertook comprehensive health and dietary assessments. Fasting plasma vitamin C concentrations (N = 369) and dietary vitamin C intake (N = 250) were determined. The mean plasma vitamin C concentration was 44.2 �mol/L (95% CI 42.4, 46.0); 62% of the cohort had inadequate plasma vitamin C concentrations (i.e., <50 �mol/L), 13% of the cohort had hypovitaminosis C (i.e., <23 �mol/L), and 2.4% had plasma vitamin C concentrations indicating deficiency (i.e., <11 �mol/L). Men had a lower mean plasma vitamin C concentration than women, and a higher percentage of vitamin C inadequacy and deficiency. A higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis C and deficiency was observed in those of lower socio-economic status and in current smokers. Adults with higher vitamin C levels exhibited lower weight, BMI and waist circumference, and better measures of metabolic health, including HbA1c, insulin and triglycerides, all risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Lower levels of mild cognitive impairment were observed in those with the highest plasma vitamin C concentrations. Plasma vitamin C showed a stronger correlation with markers of metabolic health and cognitive impairment than dietary vitamin C.
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogen causing an increasing number of nosocomial infections. Our aim was to evaluate the risk factors and mechanisms associated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) resistance in S. maltophilia infections in Mexico.
We investigated trends in deceased donor kidney availability and utilization in Saudi Arabia, wait list changes, and recipient characteristics.
To assess the 10-year cardiovascular risk in middle-aged Chinese women living in the same community and the impact of reproductive aging and age.
Observational studies have reported a high prevalence of obesity and diabetes in subjects on methadone therapy, there are, however, limited data about metabolic syndrome. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and related factors in individuals with heroin use disorder on methadone therapy.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant health risk for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Screening for CVD risk factors is a key strategy to reduce this health disparity. This study examined medical, lifestyle, and access predictors for comprehensive screening. Data on 1036 adults were analyzed from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with individuals with SMI receiving CVD risk screening in the past 12�months. The presence of a metabolic disorder (diabetes or high cholesterol), increased age, increased outpatient visits, and seeing a primary care provider, either alone or in conjunction with a specialty care provider, were significantly associated with receiving all screening measures. Increasing provider awareness of additional CVD risk factors is an essential step to improving early detection of health risks for individuals with SMI. Integrated health settings that combine traditional primary care and mental health services may reduce the health disparity for this population by increasing odds of early detection and ongoing monitoring for high-risk populations.
Our study aims to demonstrate that the use in the preconceptional period until the 24th week of pregnancy of inositol and folic acid, first of all, preserves the product of conception from neural tube defects (NTDs) and then, thanks to inositol supplementation, it possibly counteracts and prevents the onset of maternal gestational diabetes (GDM).
This communication focuses on an important, yet neglected, aspect of medicine, which has an impact on diabetes care as well. Betel quid (paan) chewing is a commonly encountered, socioculturally accepted, "culture-bound" addictive disorder. Betel quid chewing has unwanted psychotropic, carcinogenic and dysmetabolic effects. Thus, it should be discouraged as strongly as tobacco use. This communication calls for raised awareness among physicians and community leaders regarding this addictive disorder, and highlight the need for research on this topic.
To determine the clinical features and patterns of interstitial lung disease.
The aim of this study was to evaluate clinically relevant complications within 14 days after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) in a modern setting.
We recently investigated the effect of ipragliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2I), in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes by a 24-week. SGLT-2Is also have an anti-obesity effect, and reduction of body fat has been demonstrated by indirect methods. However, evaluation of the effect on the total visceral fat volume and intrahepatic lipid content has not been performed.
This study investigated unique burdens experienced by parents of young children with type 1 diabetes in the context of contemporary diabetes management.
The 2015 WHO recommendation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-positive persons calls for treatment initiation in millions of persons newly eligible with high CD4+ counts. Efficient and effective care models are urgently needed for this population. We evaluated clinical outcomes of asymptomatic HIV-positive adults and children starting ART with high CD4+ counts using a novel streamlined care model in rural Uganda and Kenya.
The purpose of this review was to provide an overview of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Complete Care management strategy.
Uric acid is the final oxidation product of purine metabolism in circulation and has been associated with the occurrence of gout and kidney stones. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are two important public health challenges, and both are linked to increased risk of cardiovascular events. Hyperuricemia has recently emerged as an independent risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension through several proposed mechanisms. Few clinical trials investigated the use of uric acid lowering agents in the management of these two disease entities; however, their results provided encouraging evidence to a potential role for these agents in fighting disease burden. Larger randomized controlled trials are therefore warranted to establish the role of uric acid as a promising target for novel therapeutic interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus is the most common comorbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF). Recently, more attention has been paid to early glucose metabolism derangements (GMDs). The subject of this report is a female patient, affected by CF since 3�months of age. She presented with intermittent diabetes during early childhood. At the age of 10�years, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and showed glucose intolerance (IGT) status; glargine insulin therapy was started. At the age of 13�years, CF-related diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia occurred, so rapid insulin at meals was added. During the following year, clinical and nutritional status improved. Stable clinical conditions were observed in the following 3�years. This is the first case of very long-term follow-up concerning a CF patient with GMDs. Our case confirms the importance of paying attention to early GMDs in very young CF patients and seems to suggest that earlier therapy could ameliorate CF natural history.
The glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide increases heart rate and may be associated with more cardiac events in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. We studied whether this could be ascribed to effects on myocardial glucose uptake (MGU), myocardial blood flow (MBF) and MBF reserve (MFR).
Intranuclear rodlets (INRs) are rod-shaped intranuclear bodies of unknown function present in the nuclei of pancreatic beta cells. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant depletion of INRs from beta cells in mouse models of type II diabetes, suggesting that they may have pathological significance. The objective of the present study was to determine whether beta cell INRs show quantitative alterations in human type II diabetes. In sections of non-neoplastic pancreas from 23 diabetic patients and 23 controls who had undergone complete or partial pancreatectomy, we detected a significant reduction in the proportion of INRs in insulin-immunoreactive beta cells. In addition, we showed that beta cell INRs are immunoreactive for the RNA-binding protein HuR. The results of this study confirm and extend our previous study and implicate this enigmatic nuclear structure in the cellular pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of type II diabetes in humans.
Diabetes mellitus in human and animal models has been correlated with low sperm count, testicular abnormalities, high levels of germ cell death, and oxidative stress. In this study, we focus on three questions: (1) Is germ cell apoptosis stage-specific in diabetic male rats? (2) Could ascorbic acid (AA) reverse oxidative and histological damage and restore testicular dysfunction? (3) Could AA treatment restore fertility parameters in diabetic rats? Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: control, diabetic, control plus AA, and diabetic plus AA. Seminiferous tubules underwent severe histological damage, together with a change in frequency of some stages of the seminiferous cycle, and germ cell apoptosis was increased in a stage-dependent manner in diabetic rats. We found a significant decrease in testosterone and higher levels of lipid peroxidation in diabetic rats when compared with controls. A major finding was that AA reversed the histological damage and peroxidation levels to control levels in diabetic rats, but testosterone levels remained unchanged. The pregnancy rate was decreased in females that mated with diabetic rats and those treated with AA, but the litter size was only reduced in the second case. Interestingly, spermatozoa from diabetic and AA-treated rats showed reduced motility and hyperactivation, but only diabetic rats had higher levels of apoptosis when compared with controls. These results suggest that treatment with AA reverses testicular damage in diabetic rats but is insufficient to restore testosterone levels, sperm motility, and fertility in a rat model.
Studies have reported that erythritol, a low�or non-glycemic sugar alcohol possesses anti-hyperglycemic and anti-diabetic potentials but the underlying mode of actions is not clear. This study investigated the underlying mode of actions behind the anti-hyperglycemic and anti-diabetic potentials of erythritol using different experimental models (experiment 1, 2 and 3).
Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a multicomponent condition, is a cardiovascular disease predictor. Although exposure to agricultural pesticides has been suggested as a potential contributor to the rising rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other features of metabolic disorders, no studies have focused on the association between consumption of organic food (produced without synthetic pesticides) and MetS. We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional association between organic food consumption and MetS in French adults to determine whether it would be worth conducting further studies, particularly large prospective and randomised trials.
Despite its widespread use as the first-line agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, it has become clear that metformin does not work optimally for everyone. Elucidating who are the likely metformin responders and non-responders is hampered by our limited knowledge of its precise molecular mechanism of action. One approach to achieve the related goals of stratifying patients into response subgroups and identifying the molecular targets of metformin involves the deployment of agnostic genome-wide approaches in cohorts of appropriate size to attain sufficient statistical power. While candidate gene studies have shed some light on the role of genetic variation in influencing metformin response, genome-wide association studies are beginning to provide additional insight that is unconstrained by prior knowledge. To fully realise their potential, much larger samples need to be assembled via international collaboration, preferably involving the academic community, government and the pharmaceutical industry.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, has various metabolic and reproductive consequences. Metformin was originally shown to lower testosterone levels in women with PCOS in the 1990s, an effect presumably related to its insulin sensitising actions. However, the precise mechanisms of metformin action in PCOS remain unclear and there is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical response to this therapy in women with PCOS. Recent evidence indicates that genetic factors may play a significant role in predicting response to metformin therapy in PCOS and future studies are needed to further identify women who are most likely to benefit from this therapy. At present, there is no clear evidence to support broad metformin use in PCOS. Well-designed prospective trials are needed to establish clear benefit for metformin use in the treatment of the reproductive and metabolic consequences associated with PCOS.
Metformin is quite frequently used off-label in type 1 diabetes to limit insulin dose requirement. Guidelines recommend that it can improve glucose control in those who are overweight and obese but evidence in support of this is limited. Recently-published findings from the REducing with MetfOrmin Vascular Adverse Lesions (REMOVAL) trial suggest that metformin therapy in type 1 diabetes can reduce atherosclerosis progression, weight and LDL-cholesterol levels. This provides a new perspective on metformin therapy in type 1 diabetes and suggests a potential role for reducing the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.
Recent studies have revealed that metformin influences gut microbiota and the immune system although neither is a classic target of the drug. This research has revealed complexity not previously appreciated, and opened new research directions. The extent to which immunomodulatory effects and actions on the microbiota are related to each other and account for effects on host energy metabolism remains to be determined. These sites of action may be relevant not only to the efficacy of metformin for its established use in type 2 diabetes, but also to proposed novel indications in oncology and other diseases.
Metformin has been prescribed in pregnancy for over 40�years; for much of this time, use has been limited both in numbers and geographically, and the evidence base has been confined to observational studies. In early years, perceived safety concerns and lack of availability of the drug in many countries acted as a barrier to use. More recently, RCTs have begun to examine the role of metformin in pregnancy in much-needed detail. However, this evidence base has been interpreted differently in different countries, leading to very wide variation in its current application in pregnancy. In this short review, we will discuss the history of metformin in pregnancy and highlight some of the key clinical trials. We will then consider some of the remaining controversies associated with metformin use in pregnancy, most important of these being the potential for long-term 'programming' effects on the fetus as a result of metformin being able to cross the placenta. We will also consider clinical situations where metformin might be avoided. Finally, we will discuss some future directions for this drug as it reaches its sixtieth anniversary.
Metformin is the most-prescribed oral medication to lower blood glucose worldwide. Yet previous systematic reviews have raised doubts about its effectiveness in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, the most costly complication of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to systematically identify and pool randomised trials reporting cardiovascular outcomes in which the effect of metformin was 'isolated' through comparison to diet, lifestyle or placebo.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease arising from the destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells. The disease represents a continuum, progressing sequentially at variable rates through identifiable stages prior to the onset of symptoms, through diagnosis and into the critical periods that follow, culminating in a variable depth of beta cell depletion. The ability to identify the very earliest of these presymptomatic stages has provided a setting in which prevention strategies can be trialled, as well as furnishing an unprecedented opportunity to study disease evolution, including intrinsic and extrinsic initiators and drivers. This niche opportunity is occupied by Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet, an international consortium of clinical trial centres that leads the field in intervention and prevention studies, accompanied by deep longitudinal bio-sampling. In this review, we focus on discoveries arising from this unique bioresource, comprising more than 70,000 samples, and outline the processes and science that have led to new biomarkers and mechanistic insights, as well as identifying new challenges and opportunities. We conclude that via integration of clinical trials and mechanistic studies, drawing in clinicians and scientists and developing partnership with industry, TrialNet embodies an enviable and unique working model for understanding a disease that to date has no cure and for designing new therapeutic approaches.
The largest and longest clinical trial of metformin for the prevention of diabetes is the Diabetes Prevention Program/Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPP/DPPOS). In this review, we summarise data from the DPP/DPPOS, focusing on metformin for diabetes prevention, as well as its long-term glycaemic and cardiometabolic effects and safety in people at high-risk of developing diabetes. The DPP (1996-2001) was a RCT of 3234 adults who, at baseline, were at high-risk of developing diabetes. Participants were assigned to masked placebo (n�=�1082) or metformin (n�=�1073) 850�mg twice daily, or intensive lifestyle intervention (n�=�1079). The masked metformin/placebo intervention phase ended approximately 1 year ahead of schedule because of demonstrated efficacy. Primary outcome was reported at 2.8 years. At the end of the DPP, all participants were offered lifestyle education and 88% (n�=�2776) of the surviving DPP cohort continued follow-up in the DPPOS. Participants originally assigned to metformin continued to receive metformin, unmasked. The DPP/DPPOS cohort has now been followed for over 15�years with prospective assessment of glycaemic, cardiometabolic, health economic and safety outcomes. After an average follow-up of 2.8�years, metformin reduced the incidence of diabetes by 31% compared with placebo, with a greater effect in those who were more obese, had a higher fasting glucose or a history of gestational diabetes. The DPPOS addressed the longer-term effects of metformin, showing a risk reduction of 18% over 10 and 15�years post-randomisation. Metformin treatment for diabetes prevention was estimated to be cost-saving. At 15�years, lack of progression to diabetes was associated with a 28% lower risk of microvascular complications across treatment arms, a reduction that was no different among treatment groups. Recent findings suggest metformin may reduce atherosclerosis development in men. Originally used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, metformin, now proven to prevent or delay diabetes, may serve as an important tool in battling the growing diabetes epidemic. Long-term follow-up, currently underway in the DPP/DPPOS, is now evaluating metformin's potential role, when started early in the spectrum of dysglycaemia, on later-stage comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Metformin is one of the most popular oral glucose-lowering medications, widely considered to be the optimal initial therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, there still remains controversy regarding the drug's precise mechanism of action, which is thought to involve a reduction in hepatic glucose production. It is now recommended as first-line treatment in various guidelines, including that of the EASD and ADA. Its favoured status lies in its efficacy, low cost, weight neutrality and good safety profile. Other benefits have also been described, including improvements in certain lipids, inflammatory markers, and a reduction in cardiovascular events, apparently independent from the drug's glucose-lowering effect. Data have emerged questioning the previous reluctance to use this agent in those with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease. Regulations guiding its use in patients with stable, modest renal dysfunction have, as a result, become more lenient in recent years. With no long-term studies comparing it against newer glucose-lowering drugs, some of which have more robust evidence for cardioprotection, metformin's established role as 'foundation therapy' in type 2 diabetes may justifiably be challenged.
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is considered to be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, as FGF21 levels are elevated in obese and diabetic conditions we aimed to test if exogenous FGF21 is sufficient to prevent diabetes and beta cell loss in New Zealand obese (NZO) mice, a model for polygenetic obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Respiratory infections and onset of islet autoimmunity are reported to correlate positively in two small prospective studies. The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study is the largest prospective international cohort study on the environmental determinants of type 1 diabetes that regularly monitors both clinical infections and islet autoantibodies. The aim was to confirm the influence of reported respiratory infections and to further characterise the temporal relationship with autoantibody seroconversion.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterised by the destruction of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas. Whilst it remains unclear what the original triggering factors for this destruction are, observations from the natural history of human type 1 diabetes, including incidence rates in twins, suggest that the disease results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Whilst many different immune cells have been implicated, including members of the innate and adaptive immune systems, a view has emerged over the past 10�years that beta cell damage is mediated by the combined actions of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells with specificity for islet autoantigens. In health, these potentially pathogenic T cells are held in check by multiple regulatory mechanisms, known collectively as 'immunological tolerance'. This raises the question as to whether type 1 diabetes develops, at least in part, as a result of a defect in one or more of these control mechanisms. Immunological tolerance includes both central mechanisms (purging of the T cell repertoire of high-affinity autoreactive T cells in the thymus) and peripheral mechanisms, a major component of which is the action of a specialised subpopulation of T cells, known as regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this review, we highlight the evidence suggesting that a reduction in the functional capacity of different Treg populations contributes to disease development in type 1 diabetes. We also address current controversies regarding the putative causes of this defect and discuss strategies to correct it as a means to reduce or prevent islet destruction in a clinical setting.
Mitochondria are important regulators of the metabolic phenotype in type 2 diabetes. A key factor in mitochondrial physiology is the H(+)-ATP synthase. The expression and activity of its physiological inhibitor, ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), controls tissue homeostasis, metabolic reprogramming and signalling. We aimed to characterise the putative role of IF1 in mediating skeletal muscle metabolism in obesity and diabetes.
The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is also increasing. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the effect of T2DM on thyroid cancer.
High on-aspirin treatment platelets reactivity (HPR) is a significant problem in long-term secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. We hypothesize that imbalance between platelets MMPs/TIMPs results in cardiovascular disorders. We also explored whether chronically elevated blood glucose affects MMP-2/TIMP-4 release from platelets.
This study was performed to investigate the effect of gastric banding surgery on the improvement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of morbidly obese (MO) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with the consideration that obesity was associated with insulin resistance and T2DM. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 38 MO with T2DM patients and 50 MO patients. Pre-surgery and post-surgery data were analyzed a year later. The medical data from these patients, including sex, age, height, weight, body composition, HbA1c, triglyceride, total cholesterol, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) were measured. There were significant reductions of body weight and body mass index (BMI), body fat, body fat percentage, waist-hip ratio, visceral fat, and obesity in each group before and after gastric banding surgery. Results of AST, ALT, and HbA1c had significant reductions in each group. For HbA1c, treatment rate was 71% in the MO group with T2DM with significant reduction of 22.8%. It is thought that a gastric banding surgery is one of the breakthrough methods not only for weight loss but also for the prevention of complication of the obese patients with T2DM. Thus, gastric banding surgery could be effective in controlling HbA1c in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The plasma membrane of mammalian cells is susceptible to disruption by mechanical and biochemical damages that frequently occur within tissues. Therefore, efficient and rapid repair of the plasma membrane is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival. Excessive damage of the plasma membrane and defects in its repair are associated with pathological conditions such as infections, muscular dystrophy, heart failure, diabetes, and lung and neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular events that remodel the plasma membrane during its repair remain poorly understood. In the present work, we report the development of a quantitative high-throughput assay that monitors the efficiency of the plasma membrane repair in real time using a sensitive microplate reader. In this assay, the plasma membrane of living cells is perforated by the bacterial pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O and the integrity and recovery of the membrane are monitored at 37�C by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the membrane impermeant dye propidium iodide. We demonstrate that listeriolysin O causes dose-dependent plasma membrane wounding and activation of the cell repair machinery. This assay was successfully applied to cell types from different origins including epithelial and muscle cells. In conclusion, this high-throughput assay provides a novel opportunity for the discovery of membrane repair effectors and the development of new therapeutic compounds that could target membrane repair in various pathological processes, from degenerative to infectious diseases.
Epicardial fat tissue has unique endocrine and paracrine functions that affect the cardiac autonomic system. The head-up tilt test (HUTT) is a simple non-invasive measurement that assesses autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We investigated the association between epicardial fat thickness (EFT) and autonomic neural tone, such as vagal tone.
Diabetes is a complex condition with a variety of causes and pathophysiologies. The current single target approach has not provided ideal clinical outcomes for the treatment of the disease and its complications. Herbal medicine has been used for the management of various diseases such as diabetes over centuries. Many diabetic patients are known to use herbal medicines with antidiabetic properties in addition to their mainstream treatments, which may present both a benefit as well as potential risk to effective management of their disease. In this review we evaluate the clinical and experimental literature on herb-drug interactions in the treatment of diabetes. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drugs and herbs are discussed, and some commonly used herbs which can interact with antidiabetic drugs summarised. Herb-drug interactions can be a double-edged sword presenting both risks (adverse drug events) and benefits (through enhancement). There is a general lack of data on herb-drug interactions. As such, more rigorous scientific research is urgently needed to guide clinical practice as well as to safeguard the wellbeing of diabetes patients.
This study aimed to determine self-monitoring practices, awareness to dietary modifications and barriers to medication adherence among physically disabled type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major unmet medical need that is characterized by the presence of multiple cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Foremost among these comorbidities are obesity and diabetes, which are not only risk factors for the development of HFpEF, but worsen symptoms and outcome. Coronary microvascular inflammation with endothelial dysfunction is a common denominator among HFpEF, obesity, and diabetes that likely explains at least in part the etiology of HFpEF and its synergistic relationship with obesity and diabetes. Thus, pharmacological strategies to supplement nitric oxide and subsequent cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-protein kinase G (PKG) signaling may have therapeutic promise. Other potential approaches include exercise and lifestyle modifications, as well as targeting endothelial cell mineralocorticoid receptors, non-coding RNAs, sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors, and enhancers of natriuretic peptide protective NO-independent cGMP-initiated and alternative signaling, such as LCZ696 and phosphodiesterase-9 inhibitors. Additionally, understanding the role of adipokines in HFpEF may lead to new treatments. Identifying novel drug targets based on the shared underlying microvascular disease process may improve the quality of life and lifespan of those afflicted with both HFpEF and obesity or diabetes, or even prevent its occurrence.
The aim of this article is to review the safety and efficacy data of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and their combination in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. Evidence for the use of the single-tablet combination formulation is also presented.
Lynch syndrome describes a familial cancer syndrome comprising germline mutations in one of four DNA mismatch repair genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 and is characterized by colorectal, endometrial, and other epithelial malignancies. Thyroid cancer is not usually considered to be part of the constellation of Lynch syndrome cancers nor have Lynch syndrome tumor gene mutations been reported in thyroid malignancies. This study reports a woman with Lynch syndrome (colonic cancer and a DNA mismatch repair mutation in the MSH2 gene) with a synchronous papillary thyroid cancer. Six years later, she developed metachronous breast cancer. Metastatic bone disease developed after 3 years, and the disease burden was due to both breast and thyroid diseases. Despite multiple interventions for both metastatic breast and thyroid diseases, the patient's metastatic burden progressed and she died of leptomeningeal metastatic disease. Two prior case reports suggested thyroid cancer may be an extraintestinal malignancy of the Lynch syndrome cancer group. Hence, this study examined the genetic relationship between the patient's known Lynch syndrome and her thyroid cancer. The thyroid cancer tissue showed normal expression of MSH2, suggesting that the tumor was not due to the oncogenic mutation of Lynch syndrome, and molecular analysis confirmed BRAF V600E mutation. Although in this case the thyroid cancer was sporadic, it raises the importance of considering cancer genetics in familial cancer syndromes when other cancers do not fit the criteria of the syndrome. Careful documentation of other malignancies in patients with thyroid cancer and their families would assist in better understanding of any potential association. Appropriate genetic testing will clarify whether a common pathogenic mechanism links seemingly unrelated cancers.
Acute exercise does not elicit compensatory changes in appetite parameters in lean individuals; however, less is known about responses in overweight individuals. This study compared the acute effects of moderate-intensity exercise on appetite, energy intake and appetite-regulatory hormones in lean and overweight/obese individuals.
Interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R), mediating IL-6's biological functions, plays an important role in different diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cardio-vascular diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), within the IL-6R loci, previously associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and coronary heart diseases risk, and with controversial effects on lipids traits: SNP rs4845625 and SNP rs4537545. The results showed that both investigated SNPs were antagonistically related with CRP levels; the minor rs4845625*T allele was associated with increased CRP levels (P-value=0.011), while the minor rs4537545*T allele was associated with decreased CRP levels (P-value=0.009). Interestingly, the minor rs4845625*T allele was significantly associated with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ApoB levels (P=0.007 and P=0.009 respectively). Haplotype analysis showed that the TC haplotype, having the minor rs4845625*T allele, was related simultaneously with increased levels of CRP, LDL-C and ApoB levels, thus could be considered as a risk factor. Our investigation detects for the first time an independent effect of rs4845625 on LDL-C and ApoB traits, explaining an important range of those traits variability (3.49 and 5.57% respectively). Our findings might be of high clinical significance in pharmacogenomics studies of tocilizumab for which IL-6R is target.Genes and Immunity advance online publication, 27 July 2017; doi:10.1038/gene.2017.16.
A 65-year-old Japanese man with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) developed acute-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) that was associated with severe acute kidney injury and was manifested by generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus. His seizures resolved without recurrence after correcting the diabetic ketoacidosis. Although hyperglycemia is an important cause of acute symptomatic seizure (ASS), patients with ketotic hyperglycemia develop ASS less frequently. In this T1D case with CKD, severe hyperglycemia in conjunction with other metabolic insults, such as uremia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia, probably provoked his seizure despite the severe ketonemia.
Werner syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized by progeria, diabetes mellitus, cataracts and various types of malignancy. However, there are few reports showing adrenal cortex cancer in subjects with Werner syndrome. We herein report an extremely rare case of Werner syndrome accompanied by adrenal cortex cancer. Based on the data obtained from blood samples, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and (131)I adosterol scintigraphy, we diagnosed this subject with adrenal cortex cancer and Cushing's syndrome. Since the prognosis of adrenal cancer is very poor, we should be aware of the possibility of adrenal cancer occurring in subjects with Werner syndrome.
The aim was to examine the predictors of improvement of quality of life after 2 years of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
Food intake is guided by homeostatic needs and by the reward value of food, yet the exact relation between the two remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of different metabolic states and hormonal satiety signaling on responses in neural reward networks.
Widespread changes in cardiac gene expression occur during heart failure, yet the mechanisms responsible for coordinating these changes remain poorly understood. The Mediator complex represents a nodal point for modulating transcription by bridging chromatin-bound transcription factors with RNA polymerase II activity; it is reversibly regulated by its cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (Cdk8) kinase submodule. Here, we identified increased Cdk8 protein expression in human failing heart explants and determined the consequence of this increase in cardiac-specific Cdk8-expressing mice. Transgenic Cdk8 overexpression resulted in progressive dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and premature lethality. Prior to functional decline, left ventricular cardiomyocytes were dramatically elongated, with disorganized transverse tubules and dysfunctional calcium handling. RNA sequencing results showed that myofilament gene isoforms not typically expressed in adult cardiomyocytes were enriched, while oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid biosynthesis genes were downregulated. Interestingly, candidate upstream transcription factor expression levels and MAPK signaling pathways thought to determine cardiomyocyte size remained relatively unaffected, suggesting that Cdk8 functions within a novel growth regulatory pathway. Our findings show that manipulating cardiac gene expression through increased Cdk8 levels is detrimental to the heart by establishing a transcriptional program that induces pathological remodeling and eccentric hypertrophy culminating in heart failure.
To develop and externally validate a prediction model for major bleeding in patients with a TIA or ischemic stroke on antiplatelet agents.
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid hormone with pleiotropic effects. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D coordinates the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, which regulate cardiovascular autonomic function and may explain its putative role in the development of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). CAN is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with diabetes and prediabetes and is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Accumulating data indicate the presence of peripheral nerve injury at these early stages of dysglycemia and its multifactorial pathogenesis. Prediabetes is associated with vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D is proposed to prevent the progression of glucose intolerance. The putative underlying mechanisms include maintenance of the intracellular calcium concentration, direct stimulation of insulin receptor expression, and enhancement of the insulin response to glucose transporters. Vitamin D exerts a protective effect on peripheral nerve fibers by decreasing the demyelination process and inducing axonal regeneration. The effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose tolerance and related autonomic nerve dysfunction have been a recent focus of scientific interest. Although well-designed observational studies are available, the causative relation between vitamin D deficiency, glucose intolerance, and CAN is still debatable. One reason might be that interventional studies are unpersuasive with regard to the beneficial clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation. Because of its favorable side effect profile, vitamin D supplementation might represent an attractive therapeutic option for treating the pandemic prevalence of prediabetes and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation can improve glucose tolerance and cardiovascular autonomic function and can thus reduce cardiovascular mortality among subjects with different stages of glucose intolerance and autonomic dysfunction. However, more patient-centered trials on the use of vitamin D supplementation in different conditions are needed.
Short-term efficacy of induction therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is well established. However, data of previous studies on maintenance therapy were limited up to 24-week treatment period. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of longer-term intravenous Ig therapy for 52 weeks.
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines advise waiting 5 to 7 days before operating on P2Y12 inhibitor-treated acute coronary syndrome patients, to allow dissipation of its antiplatelet effects. Platelet transfusion is often used to restore hemostasis during operations, but its effectiveness and optimal timing are unclear. We investigated the degree of functional gains obtained from platelet supplementation after loading and maintenance of dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor and the influence of timing on this strategy.
Adverse effects in diabetic mothers offspring (DMO) are a major concern of increasing incidence. Among these, chronic central complications in DMO remain poorly understood, and in extreme cases, diabetes can essentially function as a gestational brain insult. Nevertheless, therapeutic alternatives for DMO are limited.
In humans, the heterochronic cascade composed of the RNA-binding protein LIN28 and its major target, the let-7 family of microRNAs (miRNAs), is highly regulated during human erythroid ontogeny. Additionally, down-regulation of the let-7 miRNAs in cultured adult CD34(+) cells or the over-expression of LIN28 in cultured erythrocytes from pediatric patients with HbSS genotype causes increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in the range of 19-40% of the total. Therefore, we hypothesized that focused targeting of individual let-7 miRNA family members would exhibit regulatory effect on HbF expression in human adult erythroblasts.
The use of the Internet for searching and sharing health information and for health care interactions may have a great potential for Renal Transplant Recipients (RTR). This study aims to determine the characteristics associated with Internet and social network use in a representative sample of RTR at the time of their inclusion in the study.

This study aimed to predict the 10-year impacts of the introduction of pictorial warning labels (PWLs) on cigarette packaging in 2016 in Korea for adults using DYNAMO-HIA.
Only 1 class of glucose-lowering agents-sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors-has been reported to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events primarily by reducing the risk of the development or progression of heart failure. In a landmark trial called Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes [EMPA-REG Outcomes], long-term treatment with empagliflozin prevented fatal and nonfatal heart failure events but did not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke in diabetic patients.
The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) assesses cardiovascular disease risk factors among African Americans in Jackson, Mississippi. Whether characteristics of JHS participants differ from those of a broader African American population are unknown.
Oxidative stress (OS) contributes to all chronic diabetic complications, including diabetic nephropathy (DN). Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) has shown to confer protection from OS. However, it also has potent angiogenic activity. We hypothesized that a modified human aFGF (maFGF), with antioxidant properties but devoid of angiogenic activity, has preventative action in DN.
Treatment of mild to moderate hypertension might not benefit maternal or fetal outcome. This pessimistic point of view may have come about by using non-validated methods for measuring blood pressure in pregnancy combined with inadequate methodology for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring effects.
We examined the effect of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) on energy expenditure in adult mature mice by targeting the liver with adeno-associated viral (AAV) BMP4 vectors to increase circulating levels. We verified the direct effect of BMP4 in inducing a brown oxidative phenotype in differentiating preadipocytes in�vitro. AAV-BMP4-treated mice display marked browning of subcutaneous adipocytes, with increased mitochondria and Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1). These mice are protected from obesity on a high-fat diet and have increased whole-body energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity, reduced liver fat, and reduced adipose tissue inflammation. On a control diet, they show unchanged body weight but improved insulin sensitivity. In contrast, AAV-BMP4-treated mice showed beiging of BAT with reduced UCP1, increased lipids, and reduced hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Thus, BMP4 exerts different effects on WAT and BAT, but the overall effect is to enhance insulin sensitivity and whole-body energy expenditure by browning subcutaneous adipose tissue.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT)-dependent thermogenesis and its suggested augmenting hormone, FGF21, are potential therapeutic targets in current obesity and diabetes research. Here, we studied the role of UCP1 and FGF21 for metabolic homeostasis in the cold and dissected underlying molecular mechanisms using UCP1-FGF21 double-knockout mice. We report that neither UCP1 nor FGF21, nor even compensatory increases of FGF21 serum levels in UCP1 knockout mice, are required for defense of body temperature or for maintenance of energy metabolism and body weight. Remarkably, cold-induced browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is FGF21 independent. Global RNA sequencing reveals major changes in response to UCP1- but not FGF21-ablation in BAT, iWAT, and muscle. Markers of mitochondrial failure and inflammation are observed in BAT, but in particular the enhanced metabolic reprogramming in iWAT supports the thermogenic role of UCP1 and excludes an important thermogenic role of endogenous FGF21 in normal cold acclimation.
Beige adipocytes can interconvert between white and brown-like states and switch between energy storage versus expenditure. Here we report that beige adipocyte plasticity is important for feeding-associated changes in energy expenditure and is coordinated by the hypothalamus and the phosphatase TCPTP. A fasting-induced and glucocorticoid-mediated induction of TCPTP, inhibited insulin signaling in AgRP/NPY neurons, repressed the browning of white fat and decreased energy expenditure. Conversely feeding reduced hypothalamic TCPTP, to increase AgRP/NPY neuronal insulin signaling, white adipose�tissue browning and energy expenditure. The feeding-induced repression of hypothalamic TCPTP was defective in obesity. Mice lacking TCPTP in AgRP/NPY neurons were resistant to diet-induced obesity and had increased beige fat activity and energy expenditure. The deletion of hypothalamic TCPTP in obesity restored feeding-induced browning and increased energy expenditure to promote weight loss. Our studies define a hypothalamic switch that coordinates energy expenditure with feeding for the maintenance of energy balance.
Unimolecular dual incretins derived from hybridized glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) sequences have demonstrated synergistic reduction of adiposity in animal models and reductions of hyperglycemia in short-duration human trials. Here, we extend the characterization of NNC0090-2746 (also known as RG7697), a fatty-acylated dual agonist possessing in�vitro balanced GIPR and GLP-1R agonism. In this 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2a trial, patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin received 1.8�mg of NNC0090-2746 or placebo subcutaneously once daily. Liraglutide 1.8�mg (Victoza), starting with 2-week dose escalation, was administered subcutaneously once daily as an open-label reference arm. Measurements were collected at regular intervals after randomization. NNC0090-2746 significantly improved glycemic control and reduced body weight compared with placebo. Total cholesterol, alone among a range of lipid parameters, and leptin were both significantly reduced compared with placebo. Treatment with NNC0090-2746 was generally safe and well tolerated.
The macromolecular mechanics of GLP-1 with its cell surface receptor came into focus as two landmark publications recently published in Nature collectively herald advancement in structure-based design for a receptor class of great therapeutic importance (Jazayeri et�al., 2017; Zhang et�al., 2017).
The rise of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hallmark of menopause associated with osteoporosis and visceral adiposity. In Nature, Zaidi and colleagues (Liu et�al., 2017) report that blocking FSH action reduces body fat by promoting brown/beige fat thermogenesis, potentially providing a new intervention for the treatment of menopause-related metabolic diseases.
Plasma mannose levels are elevated in subjects with insulin resistance independently of obesity. Here, we found that elevated plasma mannose levels are strong markers of future risk of several chronic diseases including T2D, CVD, and albuminuria, and that it may contribute to their development rather than just being a novel biomarker.

Glycaemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus can be challenging, complex and influenced by many factors. This study aimed to identify patient characteristics that were predictive of satisfactory glycaemic control in the paediatric population using a logistic regression mixed-effects (population) modelling approach.
We tested the hypothesis that HDL-apolipoprotein A-I exchange (HAE), a measure of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function and a key step in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), is impaired in metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) patients who are asymptomatic for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We also compared HAE with cell-based cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) to address previous reports that CEC is enhanced in MetSyn populations.
To assess salivary flow in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and its association with xerostomia.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is believed to be irreversible although no component of the pathophysiology is irreversible. We show here with a network model that the apparent irreversibility is contributed by the structure of the network of inter-organ signalling. A network model comprising all known inter-organ signals in T2DM showed bi-stability with one insulin sensitive and one insulin resistant attractor. The bi-stability was made robust by multiple positive feedback loops suggesting an evolved allostatic system rather than a homeostatic system. In the absence of the complete network, impaired insulin signalling alone failed to give a stable insulin resistant or hyperglycemic state. The model made a number of correlational predictions many of which were validated by empirical data. The current treatment practice targeting obesity, insulin resistance, beta cell function and normalization of plasma glucose failed to reverse T2DM in the model. However certain behavioural and neuro-endocrine interventions ensured a reversal. These results suggest novel prevention and treatment approaches which need to be tested empirically.

To compare the safety, efficacy, and frequency of intravitreal injection of aflibercept and bevacizumab for treatment of macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion.
Primary dysmenorrhea (PD), or painful menstruation in the absence of identified uterine pathology, affects five to nine in every 10 reproductive-aged women. Despite its high prevalence, just a few studies with very small patient numbers have focused on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment in PD. We aimed to assess HRQoL values for a severe and a mild hypothetical PD health state by 10-year time trade-off (TTO) and willingness-to-pay (WTP) methods. In 2015, a nationwide convenience sample of women, aged between 18 and 40 years, was recruited using an Internet-based cross-sectional survey in Hungary. Respondents with a known history of secondary dysmenorrhea were excluded. Data on 1,836 and 160 women, with and without a history of PD, respectively, were analysed. Mean utility values for the severe and mild health states were 0.85 (median 0.95) and 0.94, (median 1), respectively. Participants were willing to pay a mean of &OV0556;1,127 (median &OV0556;161) and &OV0556;142 (median &OV0556;16) for a complete cure from the severe and mild PD health states. Compared to the non-PD group, women with PD valued both health states worse according to WTP (p<0.05), but similar in the TTO. It seems that PD substantially contributes to the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss in this age group, which is comparable to losses from chronic diseases such as type 1 diabetes, asthma, atopic eczema or chronic migraine. Our findings provide a useful input to cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses of PD treatments.
Hispanics in the United States experience significant health disparities. Using focus groups conducted in Spanish, we explored the perspectives of 172 Hispanic adults regarding their healthcare experiences. Many participants were women (64.5%) and primarily from Mexico (80%). Four major qualitative themes emerged: (a) provide us with information, (b) want attentive and respectful relationships, (c) want better care, and (d) perceived discrimination. Suboptimal patient-provider interactions were described. Research is needed to explore interventions that address these issues. Incorporating person-centered care principles and practices such as clear and understandable communication, culturally competent care, and customer service skills may benefit provider interactions with Hispanics.
A fully closed-loop insulin-only system was developed to provide glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes without requiring announcement of meals or activity. Our goal was to assess initial safety and efficacy of this system.
Lithium is an essential mood disorder treatment; however, it remains unclear whether lithium increases chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk. There are few data on this in the elderly, even though older adults may be particularly susceptible to CKD. We wished to determine whether lithium is associated with increased CKD risk relative to valproate in older adults.
Insulin degludec is an extra-long-acting insulin analog that allows for enhanced efficacy and flexibility in the injection time. However, it is not approved for use during pregnancy. We report the pregnancy outcome and newborn conditions in two type 1 diabetic women who continued pre-conception degludec treatment during embryogenesis. No pregnancy complication or congenital neonatal malformation was observed. Both babies presented with hypoglycemia and required neonatal intensive care unit admission. Degludec treatment did not cause adverse effects in the mothers or malformations in the newborns. The observed neonatal complications were probably independent of early pregnancy degludec treatment.

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed treatment for Type II diabetes and related disorders, however molecular insights into its mode(s) of action have been limited by an absence of structural data. Structural considerations along with an increasing body of literature demonstrating its effects on one-carbon metabolism suggest the possibility of folate mimicry and anti-folate activity. Motivated by increasing recognition that anti-diabetic biguanides may act directly upon the gut microbiome, we have determined structures of the complexes formed between the anti-diabetic biguanides: phenformin, buformin, and metformin and E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) based on NMR, crystallographic and molecular modeling studies. Inter-ligand Overhauser effects indicate that metformin can form ternary complexes with p-aminobenzoyl-L-glutamate (pABG) as well as other ligands that occupy the region of the folate binding site that interacts with pABG, however DHFR inhibition is not cooperative. The biguanides inhibit the activity of ecDHFR competitively, with Ki ~ 20 mM (metformin) or 0.2 mM (phenformin). This inhibition may be significant at concentrations present in the gut of treated individuals, and inhibition of intestinal mucosal cells may also occur if accumulated levels are sufficient. Perturbation of folate homeostasis can alter the pyridine nucleotide redox ratios that regulate cellular metabolism.
Results from epidemiological studies about the association between maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and the risk of shoulder dystocia are inconsistent.
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a subtype of prediabetes, a condition having high risk for development to diabetes mellitus (DM), but its pathophysiology is not fully understood. In the present study, we examined metabolic changes in IGT by using two types [D-glucose (Glc) and partial hydrolysate of starch (PHS)] of oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), with emphasis on serum incretins and metabolites.
Whereas some clinical studies have shown that excessive fat accumulation in the pancreas is associated with impairment of insulin secretion, others have not found such an association. (1) H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows quantitative fat analysis in various tissues including the pancreas. The pathological relevance of pancreatic fat content (PFC) in Japanese individuals remains unclear, however.
Xplor-NIH is a popular software package for biomolecular structure determination from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other data sources. Here, some of Xplor-NIH's most useful data-associated energy terms are reviewed, including newer alternative options for using residual dipolar coupling data in structure calculations. Further, we discuss new developments in the implementation of strict symmetry for the calculation of symmetric homo-oligomers, and in the representation of the system as an ensemble of structures to account for motional effects. Finally, the different available force fields are presented, among other Xplor-NIH capabilities. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Our research focuses on laxative misuse, which has been understudied in previous eating disorders (ED) research, to understand its prevalence and correlates among individuals seeking ED treatment. We also test the association between laxative misuse and binge eating to examine the assumption that laxative misuse is intended to compensate for binge eating.
We assessed the longitudinal association between tooth loss and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) within the Nurses' Health Study.
Heparanase is an enzyme which cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides of the extracellular matrix. It is a regulator of tumor behavior, plays a key role in kidney related diseases and autoimmune diabetes. We report herein the use of computational studies to extract the natural HS-heparanase interactions as a template for the design of HS mimicking glycopolymers. Upon evaluation, a glycopolymer with 12 repeating units was determined to be the most potent inhibitor and to have tight-binding characteristics. This glycopolymer also lacks anticoagulant activity.
Klinefelter syndrome is the most frequent chromosomal aneuploidy in males occurring in about 1 in 660 males. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated increased risk of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults with Klinefelter syndrome. There is only one previous report of neonatal diabetes in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome. We report transient neonatal diabetes due to a pathogenic heterozygous variant in KCNJ11 in a male infant with Klinefelter syndrome. A 78 day old male infant was noted to have sustained hyperglycemia with serum glucose ranging between 148 mg/dL (8.2 mmol/L) and 381 mg/dL (21.2 mmol/L) 3 days after undergoing a complete repair of an atrioventricular defect. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.6%. Patient was born at term with a birth weight of 2.16 kg following a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes that was controlled with diet. The patient was initially started on a continuous intravenous insulin drip and subsequently placed on subcutaneous insulin (glargine, human isophane and regular insulin]. Insulin was gradually decreased and eventually discontinued at 7 months of age. Chromosomal microarray at 11 weeks of age showed XXY and a panel-based molecular testing for neonatal diabetes revealed a pathogenic heterozygous variant c.685G>A (p.Glu229Lys) in KCNJ11. Patient is now 34 months old and continues to have normal fasting and post prandial glucose and HbA1C. Patient will need prospective follow up for assessment of glycemic status. To our knowledge this is the second reported case of neonatal diabetes in an infant with Klinefelter syndrome and the first due to a mutation in the KCNJ11 in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome.
Genetic screens using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified an array of Hsp40 (Ydj1p) J-domain mutants that are impaired in the ability to cure the yeast [URE3] prion through disrupting functional interactions with Hsp70. However, biochemical analysis of some of these Hsp40�J-domain mutants has so far failed to provide major insight into the specific functional changes in Hsp40-Hsp70 interactions. To explore the detailed structural and dynamic properties of the Hsp40�J-domain, 20�ns molecular dynamic simulations of 4 mutants (D9A, D36A, A30T, and F45S) and wild-type J-domain were performed, followed by Hsp70 docking simulations. Results demonstrated that although the Hsp70 interaction mechanism of the mutants may vary, the major structural change was targeted to the critical HPD motif of the J-domain. Our computational analysis fits well with previous yeast genetics studies regarding highlighting the importance of J-domain function in prion propagation. During the molecular dynamics simulations several important residues were identified and predicted to play an essential role in J-domain structure. Among these residues, Y26 and F45 were confirmed, using both in silico and in vivo methods, as being critical for Ydj1p function.
Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of Diabetes HealthSense on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior changes that prevent, delay, or manage diabetes among people at risk (PAR) for diabetes and people with diabetes (PWD). Methods Using a 2-group pretest-posttest design, 15 community sites were randomly assigned to either an intervention or comparison group. Intervention participants attended a group education session with a diabetes educator, followed by 4 weeks of independent use of the Diabetes HealthSense website. The comparison group received no intervention. A total of 311 adults (n = 135 intervention, n = 176 comparison) completed both a pretest and posttest. Outcome measures examined changes in self-reported knowledge, self-efficacy, and behaviors that support diabetes prevention or management. Results Statistically significant within-group pretest to posttest changes were found for almost all outcome measures in the intervention group, with no significant changes in the comparison group. Significant between-group differences were also found for almost all outcome measures at posttest, with the intervention group having more positive outcomes than the comparison group. Conclusions Patient referral to online tools is considered one key component of initial and ongoing diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S) and is recommended as a way to enhance and extend the reach of in-person diabetes education. Positive outcomes were found for PWD/PAR who used Diabetes HealthSense following a guided education session. Study results suggested that with guided exploration, Diabetes HealthSense provided a valuable tool for educators to use with patients to support and extend the reach of DSME/S.
Prospective clinical plasma biomarker studies in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis have been hampered by the need for very large cohorts and long follow-up time. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of adrenomedullin, a cardiovascular (CV) stress marker, and incident AAA risk. Prospective longitudinal cohort of middle-aged individuals from the CV cohort of the Malm� Diet and Cancer Study (n = 5551; 1991-1994) was assessed. Plasma concentrations of midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), C-reactive protein (CRP), and conventional risk factors were measured at baseline. Incidence of AAA was studied up to December 31, 2013. Cumulative incidence of AAA was 1.5% (men 2.9%, women 0.5%). Mean age of individuals with incident AAA was 59.7 years at study entry, and AAA was diagnosed on average 14 years later. Adjusting for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and CRP, MR-proADM (hazard ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.62) was independently associated with incident AAA. The plasma biomarker MR-proADM seems to be a marker of AAA risk, implying that AAA development may be driven by long-standing CV stress on the aortic wall.
The aim of the study reported here was to assess the influence of serum HbA1c levels on foveal choroidal thickness in diabetic patients.
This review aimed to examine the latest evidence linking cigarette smoking and cessation to risk of incident diabetes and its complications.
We reviewed published literature to determine the relationship between A1c and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and summarize the need and implications for CVD risk reduction with interventions, focusing in the prediabetic A1c range (<6.5%).
Antenatal obesity and associated gestational diabetes (GDM) are increasing worldwide. While pre-existing insulin resistance is implicated in GDM in obese women, the responsible metabolic pathways remain poorly described. Our aim was to compare metabolic profiles in blood of obese pregnant women with and without GDM 10�weeks prior to and at the time of diagnosis by OGTT.
African-American (AA) female cancer survivors share a disproportionate burden of diabetes compared to their white counterparts. Our objectives were to explore the perspectives of AA survivors with type 2 diabetes on perceived barriers to physical activity (PA) and preferences for a PA intervention and develop a framework for a PA program after cancer treatment.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for anastomotic leakage (AL) after anterior resection for middle and low rectal cancer in order to help surgeons to decide which patients could benefit from a diverting stoma.
The prevalence of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) is increasing with the aging of the population. Studies from the last several years have shown that people with diabetes have an increased risk for dementia and cognitive impairment. Therefore, the authors of this consensus review tried to elaborate on the role of diabetes, especially diabetes type 2 (T2DM) in both AD and VaD. Based on the clinical and experimental work of scientists from 18 countries participating in the International Congress on Vascular Disorders and on literature search using PUBMED, it can be concluded that T2DM is a risk factor for both, AD and VaD, based on a pathology of glucose utilization. This pathology is the consequence of a disturbance of insulin-related mechanisms leading to brain insulin resistance. Although the underlying pathological mechanisms for AD and VaD are different in many aspects, the contribution of T2DM and insulin resistant brain state (IRBS) to cerebrovascular disturbances in both disorders cannot be neglected. Therefore, early diagnosis of metabolic parameters including those relevant for T2DM is required. Moreover, it is possible that therapeutic options utilized today for diabetes treatment may also have an effect on the risk for dementia. T2DM/IRBS contribute to pathological processes in AD and VaD.
Cardiac electrophysiology is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, and this has both pathophysiological, and possibly therapeutic importance. Furthermore, chamber differences in electrophysiology exist between atria and ventricles, yet there have been few direct comparisons. There is substantial literature on ion channel modulation at the single-cell level but less work on how this affects tissue-level parameters. We used a microelectrode array system to explore these issues using murine atrial and ventricular tissue slices. Activation time, conduction velocity and repolarisation were measured, and their modulation by temperature and pharmacological autonomic agonists were assessed. The system recorded reliable measurements under control conditions in the absence of drug/thermal challenge, and significant baseline differences were found in chamber electrophysiology. The sodium channel blocker mexiletine, produced large magnitude changes in all three measured parameters. Carbachol and isoprenaline induced differing effects in atria and ventricles, whereas temperature produced similar effects on activation and repolarisation.
In the last 15 years, it emerged that the practice of regular physical activity reduces the risks of many diseases (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc.) and it is fundamental in weight control and energy consuming to contrast obesity. Different groups proposed many molecular mechanisms as responsible for the positive effects of physical activity in healthy life. However, many points remain to be clarified. In this mini-review we reported the latest observations on the effects of physical exercise on healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle focusing on muscle stem cells. The last ones represent the fundamental elements for muscle regeneration post injury, but also for healthy muscle homeostasis. Interestingly, in both muscle tissues the morphological consequence of physical activity is a physiological hypertrophy that depends on different phenomena both in differentiated cells and stem cells. The signaling pathways for physical exercise effects present common elements in skeletal and cardiac muscle, like activation of specific transcription factors, proliferative pathways, and cytokines. More recently, post translational (miRNAs) or epigenetic (DNA methylation) modifications have been demonstrated. However, several points remain unresolved thus requiring new research on the effect of exercise on muscle stem cells.
A high intake of products containing fructose is known to mediate insulin resistance. In the liver, AMPD2, an isoform of AMPD, has important glucose metabolic homeostasis functions including maintenance of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We speculated that AMPD2 induces impaired glucose tolerance in individuals who consume a high-fructose diet. We gave either a normal-chow (NCD) or high-fructose (HFrD) diet for 40�days to 8-week-old male wild-type (WT) and Ampd2�-/- homozygote (A2�-/-) C57BL/6 mice. A glucose tolerance test (GTT) and pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) were used to evaluate glucose metabolism. In addition, gluconeogenesis and glycolysis enzymes, and AMPK phosphorylation in the liver were investigated. With consumption of the HFrD, A2�-/- mice showed enhanced glucose tolerance in GTT and PTT results as compared to the WT mice, which were independent of changes in body weight. Also, the levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes) were significantly reduced in A2�-/- as compared to WT mice. The hepatic glycolytic enzymes glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase were also examined, though there were no significant differences between genotypes in regard to both mRNA expression and protein expression under HFrD. Surprisingly, hepatic AMPK phosphorylation resulted in no changes in the A2�-/- as compared to WT mice under these conditions. Our results indicated that Ampd2-deficient mice are protected from high fructose diet-induced glycemic dysregulation, mainly because of gluconeogenesis inhibition, and indicate a novel therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes as an independent driver of peri-operative outcomes, and whether its severity impacts indications is conflicted in the research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate diabetes as a predictor for postoperative outcomes in cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients.
Complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, are associated with increased mortality among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Homocysteine has been recently identified as a predictor of cardiovascular disease-related complications in diabetes. We investigated whether or not supplementation with folic acid tablets can lower homocysteine levels and improve parameters related with vascular complications.
The Korean Vascular Intervention Society Endovascular Therapy in Lower Limb Artery Diseases (K-VIS ELLA) Registry is a multicenter observational study with retrospective and prospective cohorts of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) undergoing endovascular treatment. In this study, we report the baseline characteristics of this retrospective cohort.
Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) disease. They are also important contributors to metabolic diseases including diabetes that further increase CV risk. Updated guidelines emphasize targeted reduction of overall CV risks but do not explicitly incorporate potential adverse metabolic outcomes that also influence CV health. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension have synergistic deleterious effects on interrelated insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system is an important pathophysiological mechanism linking insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction to atherogenesis. Statins are the reference standard treatment to prevent CV disease in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Statins work best for secondary CV prevention. Unfortunately, most statin therapies dose-dependently cause insulin resistance, increase new onset diabetes risk and exacerbate existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pravastatin is often too weak to achieve target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels despite having beneficial metabolic actions. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors improve both endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in addition to controlling blood pressure. In this regard, combined statin-based and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor therapies demonstrate additive/synergistic beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and other metabolic parameters in addition to lowering both cholesterol levels and blood pressure. This combined therapy simultaneously reduces CV events when compared to either drug type used as monotherapy. This is mediated by both separate and interrelated mechanisms. Therefore, statin-based therapy combined with RAS inhibitors is important for developing optimal management strategies in patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or obesity. This combined therapy can help prevent or treat CV disease while minimizing adverse metabolic consequences.
To clarify the prevalence and symptomatic characteristics of sleep disturbance/insomnia among type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) Japanese patients.
Genomic transposable elements (TEs) comprise nearly half of the human genome. The expression of TEs is considered potentially hazardous, as it can lead to insertional mutagenesis and genomic instability. However, recent studies have revealed that TEs are involved in immune-mediated cell clearance. Hypomethylating agents can increase the expression of TEs in cancer cells, inducing 'viral mimicry', causing interferon signalling and cancer cell killing. To investigate the role of TEs in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we studied TE expression in several cell fractions of AML while tracking its development (pre-leukemic haematopoietic stem cells, leukemic stem cells [LSCs], and leukemic blasts). LSCs, which are resistant to chemotherapy and serve as reservoirs for relapse, showed significant suppression of TEs and interferon pathways. Similarly, high-risk cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) showed far greater suppression of TEs than low-risk cases. We propose TE suppression as a mechanism for immune escape in AML and MDS. Repression of TEs co-occurred with the upregulation of several genes known to modulate TE expression, such as RNA helicases and autophagy genes. Thus, we have identified potential pathways that can be targeted to activate cancer immunogenicity via TEs in AML and MDS.
Integration of oral health care professionals (OHCPs) into medical care could advance efforts to control increasingly prevalent conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and hepatitis C infection, each of which is associated with significant morbidity and health care costs. Prevention and early intervention are effective for reducing the incidence and severity of these diseases, while increasing cost of health care may drive the need for nontraditional models of health education and delivery. Studies have suggested that a dental office is a suitable setting for the purpose of screening and referrals for these conditions and may result in medical expenditure savings. Such innovations would challenge the current dental educational model and the education and training of faculty. Implementing this change would require recognizing opportunities and challenges for the profession and the need for new competencies in dental curricula. Challenges and opportunities are described, including reimbursement models and integration of OHCPs into emerging health care delivery models. Ideas for curricular change are presented, including the need for added emphasis on biological sciences and the introduction of new courses to address systems thinking and forces driving preventive behavior. To embrace the evolving health care arena and be a part of the future interprofessional health care delivery dynamic, dental curricula should also include substantive interprofessional education opportunities. Such opportunities would provide the basic skills and training to recognize and appreciate patients' oral health issues in the broader context of their overall health and well-being. This article was written as part of the project "Advancing Dental Education in the 21(st) Century."
Physicians responsible for the care of patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction have access to a broad range of evidence-based treatments that prolong life and reduce symptoms. In spite of the significant progress made over the last four decades, there is an ongoing need for novel therapies to treat a condition that is associated with stubbornly high morbidity and mortality. In this article, we discuss the findings of SERVE-HF, a randomised controlled trial of adaptive servo-ventilation in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as well as EMPA-REG, a study of the effects of a novel diabetic agent that may be of greater interest to heart failure specialists than diabetologists. We also examine further analyses of the groundbreaking PARADIGM-HF trial, which attempt to answer some of the unresolved questions from the original study of the first combined angiotensin-receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril valsartan. The recently published National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for the management of acute heart failure and plans to introduce best practice tariffs bring into focus the need for well-organised, multidisciplinary care. We discuss the challenges involved in developing and delivering a specialist service that meets the needs of a growing population of patients living with heart failure.
Differing associations of vascular risk factors with lacunar infarct have been reported, which is likely because of diagnostic differences and possible heterogeneity in the pathogenesis underlying lacunar infarction. In a large magnetic resonance imaging-verified cohort of lacunar infarct patients, we investigated the risk factor profile of lacunar infarction and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics.
Due to the mass and functions in metabolism, skeletal muscle is one of major organs regulating whole-body metabolic homeostasis. SIRT6, a histone deacetylase, has been shown to regulate metabolism in liver and brain, however, its specific role in skeletal muscle is undetermined. In the present study we explored physiological function of SIRT6 in muscle. We generated a muscle-specific SIRT6 knockout mouse model. The mice with SIRT6 deficiency in muscle displayed impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, attenuated whole-body energy expenditure and weakened exercise performance. Mechanistically, deletion of SIRT6 in muscle decreased expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid uptake, fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in muscle cells due to the reduced AMPK activity. In contrast, overexpression of SIRT6 in C2C12 myotubes activates AMPK. Our results from both gain- and loss-of-function experiments identify SIRT6 as a physiological regulator of muscle mitochondrial function. These findings indicate that SIRT6 is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of T2DM.
To assess the numbers of obese children and young people (CYP) eligible for assessment and management at each stage of the childhood obesity pathway in England.
To define the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and determine whether OSA diagnosis predicts future cardiovascular disease (CVD) and noncardiac vascular events.
Simple and low-cost tools to monitor the risk profile of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) at high risk of complications and mortality are scarce. One of the tools available to monitor the variation in vitality and dependence levels is the Karnofsky performance status (KPS). This study analyzed the average trends and variation of KPS during the 12 months before death and its independent value in predicting patients' survival.
Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor cardiac outcomes and mortality. It is not known whether HF leads to poor renal outcomes in patients with normal kidney function. We hypothesized that HF is associated with worse long-term renal outcomes.
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a severe blinding condition. We investigated whether retinal metabolism, measured by retinal oximetry, may predict PDR activity after panretinal laser photocoagulation (PRP).
To summarise incidence and prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the overall patient population and different subgroups (age, sex, geographical region, ethnicity and type of insulin administration).
To investigate whether there were differences and consistent patterns that highlight and consolidate the metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a meta-analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was conducted. PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched up to August 2016 for collecting the relevant studies. After an inclusion and exclusion criteria, the data was extracted. The data was analyzed using Stata software v.12.0. The weight mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to compare continuous variables. A total of 10 studies (with a total of 244 T2DM patients and 223 healthy controls) were included. N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) levels were decreased in the frontal lobe (MD=-0.20, 95%CI=-0.33 to -0.06, P=0.005) and lenticular nucleus (MD=-0.14, 95%CI=-0.22 to -0.06, P=0.001); choline (Cho)/Cr levels were increased in the lenticular nucleus (MD=0.15, 95%CI=0.02-0.28, P=0.025); myo-inositol (MI)/Cr levels were increased in the in the occipital lobe (MD=0.11, 95%CI=0.02-0.19, P=0.017) and parietal lobe (MD=0.16, 95%CI=0.05-0.28, P=0.006); MI levels were increased in the frontal white matter (MD=0.52, 95%CI=0.14-0.90, P=0.008). The results of our meta-analysis indicated that metabolite levels were altered in different regions of brain, which may be shown with MRS and caused clinical symptoms in T2DM further.
In the present study, we aimed to identify the comorbidities that would be predictive of requiring lower extremity amputation or reamputation for diabetic foot wounds. We performed a retrospective review of 132 consecutive patients who had undergone lower extremity amputations (110 patients) or reamputations (22 patients) for diabetic wounds from January 2013 to March 2016. We used multivariate logistic regression to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for amputation and reamputation for various comorbidities. The ORs of undergoing amputation were greatest for adult males (OR 5.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56 to 13.04; p�=�.05) and those with longer term diabetes (OR 4.22, 95% CI 2.01 to 12.95; p�=�.05), wound infection (OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.04 to 9.00; p�=�.05), diabetic neuropathy (OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.07 to 9.11; p�=�.05), and a positive history of smoking (OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.55 to 9.89; p�=�.05). Similarly, the ORs of undergoing reamputation were greatest for adult males (OR 4.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 12.08; p�=�.05) and those with longer term diabetes (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.94 to 11.42; p�=�.05), wound infection (OR 3.12; 95% CI 0.9 to 8.32; p�=�.05), diabetic neuropathy (OR 3.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 8.54; p�=�.05), and a positive history of smoking (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.09 to 9.42; p�=�.05). The early identification of these comorbidities could help determine which patients are most likely to require amputation or reamputation.
Approximately 10-15% of persons living with HIV (PLWH) have a comorbid diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM). Both of these long-term chronic conditions are associated with high rates of symptom burden. The purpose of our study was to describe symptom patterns for PLWH with DM (PLWH+DM) using a large secondary dataset. The prevalence, burden, and bothersomeness of symptoms reported by patients in routine clinic visits during 2015 were assessed using the 20-item HIV Symptom Index. Principal component analysis was used to identify symptom clusters. Three main clusters were identified: (a) neurological/psychological, (b) gastrointestinal/flu-like, and (c) physical changes. The most prevalent symptoms were fatigue, poor sleep, aches, neuropathy, and sadness. When compared to a previous symptom study with PLWH, symptoms clustered differently in our sample of patients with dual diagnoses of HIV and diabetes. Clinicians should appropriately assess symptoms for their patients' comorbid conditions.
The burden of diabetes-related chronic kidney disease (CKD) on individuals and society is increasing, shifting attention toward improving the quality of care for patients with CKD and diabetes. We assessed the quality of CKD care and its association with long-term dialysis, acute kidney injury (AKI), and death.
To further characterize clinical characteristics, etiologic factors, associated disorders, and treatment of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP).
Potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) are widely used in institutionalized older adults, yet the key determinants that drive their use are incompletely characterized.
Aortic vascular stiffness has been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in obese individuals. However, the mechanism promoting these adverse effects are unclear. In this context, promotion of obesity through consumption of a western diet (WD) high in fat and fructose leads to excess circulating uric acid. There is accumulating data implicating elevated uric acid in the promotion of CVD and CKD. Accordingly, we hypothesized that xanthine oxidase(XO) inhibition with allopurinol would prevent a rise in vascular stiffness and proteinuria in a translationally relevant model of WD-induced obesity.
The aim of this study was to compare the short-term effect of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (DS) in order to determine if exclusion of the upper gastrointestinal tract confers greater metabolic improvement, independent of weight loss.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy. During pregnancy, women with GDM develop insulin resistance, which results in altered glucose tolerance. As a result, there are frequent episodes of hyperglycemia and high levels of circulating amino acids, increasing the transfer of nutrients to the fetus. This article discusses the role of the mother-baby nursing in the care of neonates born to women with gestational diabetes.
Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is a rare disorder, with a reported incidence of approximately 1 in 450,000 live births. It is characterized by insulin-requiring hyperglycemia in the neonatal period. The disease improves by early childhood, but the patient may relapse in later life. Diagnosis is made after genetic testing following presentation with hyperglycemia not conforming to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Management is based on insulin and possible sulfonylurea administration. Three genetically distinct subtypes of TNDM are recognized. Type 1 TNDM is due to overexpression of genes at the 6q24 locus, whereas the 11p15 locus is involved in Type 2 and 3 TNDM. In this article the clinical presentation, management, and genetics of TNDM are discussed, particularly emphasizing the role of the neonatal nurse.
Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is a rare and severe condition requiring lifelong steroid replacement. During acute illness or stressful events, it is important to appropriately adjust glucocorticoid dose; failure to do so may lead to an adrenal crisis. The aim of the study was to explore patients PAI knowledge and understanding of the condition, steroid replacement adjustment during acute illness or stress and provided education.
This study aimed to establish a model that estimates the survival advantage at the molecular level based on telomere length and serum biomarkers of aging, to explore clinical significance.
In 2007, universal screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was introduced in Tamil Nadu, India. To identify factors hindering or facilitating timely initiation and completion of the GDM screening and diagnosis process, our study investigated how pregnant women in rural and urban Tamil Nadu access and navigate different GDM related health services.
Leishmaniasis and melioidosis are frequently reported from the North Central Province of Sri Lanka. However, only one case of co-infection of the two diseases has been reported to date over the world. This is a case report of a patient who had co-infection with cutaneous leishmaniasis and melioidosis and was successfully treated and recovered from the illness.
Since diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD), this study aimed to develop a 5-year ESRD risk prediction model among Chinese patients with Type 2 DM (T2DM) in primary care.
The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and predictors of Fanconi Syndrome (FS) in a cohort of patients taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Clinical records and laboratory investigations from patients receiving TDF between 2002 and 2016 were extracted. FS was defined as normoglycaemic glycosuria and proteinuria and at least one other marker of renal dysfunction. Regression analysis was performed with time to development of FS and the following covariates: ritonavir co-administration, age, gender, co-morbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, viral hepatitis), CD4 cell count nadir and baseline eGFR. One thousand and forty-four patients received TDF without ritonavir and 398 patients with ritonavir. Thirteen cases of FS were identified with a mean duration of exposure of 55 months. The incidence of FS was 1.09/1000PY (0.54-1.63) of TDF exposure (without ritonavir) and 5.50/1000PY (3.66-7.33) of TDF-ritonavir co-administration (p=0.0057). The adjusted hazards ratio for ritonavir co-administration was 4.71 (1.37-16.14, p=0.014). Known risk factors for chronic kidney disease were not associated with development of FS. Ritonavir co-administration, but not other factors, is associated with a greater risk of FS. FS developed late. Known risk factors for chronic kidney disease and length of treatment are not useful for identifying patients most at risk of developing FS in patients taking TDF.
Pyelonephritis (PN) is a suppurative infection of the kidney, most commonly due to bacterial infection and may be either acute or chronic. Acute PN (APN) subdivided into uncomplicated and complicated. Severity of PN cannot be assessed by clinical or laboratorial parameters alone, radiological imaging such as Ultrasound (USG) abdomen, Computed Tomography (CT) is required to know the nature, extent and severity of disease and for planning interventions.
Literature is sparse on the clinical correlation of six minute walk test (6MWT) and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels in ischemic Cardiomyopathy (Ischemic CMP) patients. New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is most commonly used for functional assessment of Heart Failure (HF), which is very subjective. This limitation is overcome by 6MWT which has prognostic significance in addition to assessment of level of functional impairment. Serum BNP correlate with clinical severity of HF as assessed by NYHA class.
Teneligliptin is a recently developed Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor. Teneligliptin is suitable for glycaemic control with renal impairment including end stage renal disease.
Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by earlier elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and increased risk for premature Myocardial Infarction (MI). Albeit the diagnosis of some medical Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) cases are due to mutations in PCSK9, APOB, or LDLR, detection of mutation rate and profiles relies heavily on different gene pools and ethnicity. We ran exome sequencing on blood genomic DNA (gDNA) from a 26-year-old Saudi patient on Ion Proton Platform (Ion Torrent, Guilford, Connecticut, USA) as part of a pilot study preluding the establishment of the Saudi Human Genome project. The sequencing results were analysed using Ion suit Bioinformatics system. The patient was matched with a lady of lean body mass and Welsh descent, who suffered from hypercholesterolemia. The first analysis of known FH genes identified five mutations in APOB, 25 mutations of known genes linked to FH, six mutations in LPR2, one mutation in LDLR, and three mutations in PCSK9. Finally, using disease filter algorithms, we filtered out more than 2000 intronic synonymous variants with likely no biological functions. No major new locus was found in FH. However, via variant reduction and TVC protocols we detected 15 new variants, among which 14 genes are linked to hypercholesterolemia, type-I, and type-II diabetes. We also detected three mutations in PCSK9 and confirmed one by Sanger. Taken together, this report suggests that the genetic determinant of FH in this Saudi patient is likely to be heterogeneous, complicating the diagnostic and novel gene discovery process.
Diabetes mellitus is a group of common metabolic disorders sharing the phenotype of hyperglycaemia. Certain disadvantages like side effects or less efficacy limit the optimal use of antidiabetic drugs.
Excess adiposity constitute an important public health problem because of the associated increased risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and other disorders. Not only the contribution of general measures of adiposity but also central measures of adiposity have been observed.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the starch digestibility and predicted glycemic index in breads incorporated with pomelo fruit (Citrus maxima) segments. Volume of the white and brown breads supplemented with pomelo fresh segments increased, while the crumb firmness decreased. Bread with 20% fresh and 5% dry pomelo segments were sensorily acceptable. Bioactive components such as phenolics, flavonoids, naringin and carotenoids were retained to a greater extent in bread containing dry pomelo segments. The pomelo incorporated bread had higher levels of resistant starch fractions (3.87-10.96%) with low predicted glycemic index (62.97-53.13%), despite their higher total starch (69.87-75.47%) content compared to control bread. Thus pomelo segments in the product formulations lowered the glycemic index probably by inhibiting carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme activity which could be attributed to naringin. Hence fortified bread prepared from pomelo fruit segment is recommended to gain nutritional value and to decrease the risk of diabetes.
Objective: To explore whether diabetes mellitus (DM) impairs functions of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPC) and circulating EPC. Methods: Diabetic model of rabbit was induced by Alloxan injection and the rabbits were then randomly divided into three groups: BM-EPC group, circulating EPC group, and DM group, with six rabbits in each group. Another 6 normal rabbits were enrolled as normal control group as well. 8 weeks later, BM-EPC and circulating EPC from diabetic and healthy rabbits were isolated and cultured. Colony number, proliferation, adhesion and tube formation function were detected. Exogenous diabetic BM-EPC and circulating EPC were analyzed for therapeutic efficacy in acute ischemia model of diabetic rabbits. Left ventricular (LV) function was assessed using Echocardiography. Capillary density and fibrosis area were evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and Masson-trichrome staining. The mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was analyzed using real-time quantitive PCR. Results: Colony number, proliferation, adhesion and tube formation function of diabetic circulating EPC were significantly reduced compared with healthy rabbits. DM impaired tube-forming ability of BM-EPC, but did not influence colony number, proliferation and adhesion function. Compared with circulating EPC and control group, BM-EPC group had fewer fibrosis area (6.98%�0.94% vs 13.03%�2.97% and 15.84%�4.74%, both P=0.001), higher capillary density [(792�87) vs (528�71) and (372�77) vessels/mm(2,) both P<0.001], higher mRNA expression of VEGF (6.25�2.33 vs 2.19�1.01 and 1.55�0.52, both P<0.001) and bFGF (6.38�2.65 vs 1.24�0.76 and 1.18�0.82, both P<0.001), higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (61%�4% vs 47%�5% and 50%�10%, both P<0.05). Conclusions: DM not only impaired functions of circulating EPC, but also influenced tube formation function of BM-EPC. Auto transplantation of BM-EPC may rescue the ischemic myocardium by neovascularization and paracrine effect in diabetic rabbits.
Objective: To investigate the relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: A total of 400 patients who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism of Jinshan Branch, Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital between April 2014 and December 2015 were divided into normouricemia (NUA, n=319) group and hyperuricemia (HUA, n=81) group according to the presence of HUA. Clinical features of the two groups were compared. Patients were further stratified into quartiles based on SUA levels, and then association between hs-CRP and SUA was analyzed. Results: Compared to the NUA group, the patients with HUA had higher hs-CRP concentration [2.12 (1.15, 6.73) mg/L vs 1.14 (0.52, 3.44) mg/L, P<0.001], erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [19.0 (10.5, 29.5) mm/h vs 12.0 (8.0, 17.0) mm/h, P<0.001], body mass index (BMI) [(25.2�3.6) kg/m(2) vs (23.6�3.6) kg/m(2,) P<0.001], and homeostasis model assessment-2 of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) index [1.88 (1.11, 2.94) vs 1.27 (0.77, 2.00), P<0.001]. After adjusting for age, the median level of hs-CRP of female with HUA was higher than that of male, female with NUA, and male with NUA (2.59, 1.94, 1.25 and 1.09 mg/L, respectively, P<0.001). There was significant difference in the prevalence of HUA among the patients with underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity (0, 12.3%, 21.6% and 25.8%, respectively, P=0.002). After adjusting for age and gender, duration of diabetes, BMI, serum lipids, level of SUA was still correlated with hs-CRP, HOMA2-IR, fasting C-peptide, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, Cystatin C, microalbuminuria, respectively(all P<0.05). The level of SUA was positively associated with the increase of hs-CRP level (P=0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that there was an independent and positive association between SUA and hs-CRP levels. Conclusion: SUA was independently associated with hs-CRP in T2DM patients, which suggested that chronic inflammation exists in HUA patients.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a common chronic liver disease closely associated with obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. It can gradually progress to liver cirrhosis or even hepatocellular carcinoma; however, there are still no specific therapeutic agents for this disease. Liraglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue and has a marked effect in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. At present, many studies indicate that liraglutide also has a certain therapeutic effect on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease during the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. This article reviews the known mechanisms of action of liraglutide in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Obesity is an excess accumulation of adipose tissue mass, and, together with its sequelae, in particular type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome, obesity presents a major health crisis. Although obesity is simply caused by increased adipose mass, the heterogeneity of adipose tissue in humans means that the response to increased energy balance is highly complex. Individual subjects with similar phenotypes may respond very differently to the same treatments; therefore, obesity may benefit from a personalized precision medicine approach. The variability in the development of obesity is indeed driven by differences in sex, genetics, and environment, but also by the various types of adipose tissue as well as the different cell types that compose it. By describing the distinct cell populations that reside in different fat depots, we can interpret the complex effect of these various players in the maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis. To further understand adipose tissue, adipogenic differentiation and the transcriptional program of lipid accumulation must be investigated. As the cell- and depot-specific functions are described, they can be placed in the context of energy excess to understand how the heterogeneity of adipose tissue shapes individual metabolic status and condition.
Pectins isolated from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer are potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, a global health challenge. Soil-to-bench procedures of ginseng pectin preparation significantly affect the polysaccharide structures. Various forms of ginseng pectins rich in homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan-I, rhamnogalacturonan-II, and arabinogalactan have demonstrated independent or collaborative effects on hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, immunological dysfunction, and neoplasms. Monosaccharide compositions, peptide contents, degrees of esterification and methylation, and inter- and intramolecular linkages all influence pectin bioactivity. Understanding the preparation-structure and structure-function relationships of ginseng pectins can lead to safer and more pertinent treatment of diabetes with efficacy-oriented modifications of the pectins. To reach this goal, standardization of preparation procedures, understanding of intricate structures, and exploration of complex interactions with receptors are crucial steps to take full advantage of the medical potential of ginseng pectins.
The production of reactive species is an inevitable by-product of metabolism and thus, life itself. Since reactive species are able to damage cellular structures, especially proteins, as the most abundant macromolecule of mammalian cells, systems are necessary which regulate and preserve a functional cellular protein pool, in a process termed "proteostasis". Not only the mammalian protein pool is subject of a constant turnover, organelles are also degraded and rebuild. The most important systems for these removal processes are the "ubiquitin-proteasomal system" (UPS), the central proteolytic machinery of mammalian cells, mainly responsible for proteostasis, as well as the "autophagy-lysosomal system", which mediates the turnover of organelles and large aggregates. Many age-related pathologies and the aging process itself are accompanied by a dysregulation of UPS, autophagy and the cross-talk between both systems. This review will describe the sources and effects of oxidative stress, preservation of cellular protein- and organelle-homeostasis and the effects of aging on proteostasis in mammalian cells.
Increases in the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have aroused strong interest in identifying antioxidants from natural sources for use in preventive medicine. Citrus macroptera (C. macroptera), commonly known as "Satkara", is an important herbal and medicinal plant reputed for its antioxidant, nutritious and therapeutic uses. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cardio-protective effects of ethanol extracts of C. macroptera peel and pulp against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. Male albino Wistar rats (n=36) were pre-treated with peel and pulp extracts (500mg/kg) for 45days. They received a challenge with ISO (85mg/kg) on the 44th and 45th days. Our findings indicated that subcutaneous injection of ISO induced severe myocardial injuries associated with oxidative stress, as confirmed by elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decreased cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and anti-peroxidative enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase, compared with levels observed in control animals. Pre-treatment with C. macroptera peel and pulp extracts prior to ISO administration however, significantly improved many of the investigated biochemical parameters, i.e., cardiac troponin I, cardiac marker enzymes, lipid profile and oxidative stress markers. The fruit peel extract showed stronger cardio-protective effects than the pulp extract. The biochemical findings were further confirmed by histopathological examinations. Overall, the increased endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity against heightened oxidative stress in the myocardium is strongly suggestive of the cardio-protective potential of C. macroptera.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an individual intervention given by health care professionals to dropouts with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on their metabolic profile.
Exercise is capable of influencing the regulation of energy balance by acutely modulating appetite and energy intake coupled to effects on substrate utilization. Yet, few studies have examined acute effects of exercise intensity on aspects of both energy intake and energy metabolism, independently of energy cost of exercise. Furthermore, little is known as to the gender differences of these effect. One hour after a standardised breakfast, 40 (19 female), healthy participants (BMI 23.6�3.6 kg.m-2, VO2peak 34.4�6.8 ml.min-1.min-1) undertook either High intensity intermittent cycling consisting of 8 repeated 60s bouts of cycling at 95% VO2peak (HIIC) or low intensity continuous cycling, equivalent to 50% VO2peak (LICC), matched for energy cost (~950kJ) followed by 90mins of rest, in a randomised crossover design. Throughout each study visit satiety was assessed subjectively using visual analogue scales alongside blood metabolites and GLP-1. Energy expenditure and substrate utilization were measured over 75 minutes post-exercise via indirect calorimetry. Energy intake was assessed for 48hours post-intervention. No differences in appetite, GLP-1 or energy intakes were observed between HIIC and LICC, with or without stratifying for gender. Significant differences in post exercise non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations were observed between intensities in both genders, coupled to a significantly lower respiratory exchange ratio (RER) following HIIC (P=0.0028), with a trend towards greater reductions in RER in men(P=0.079). In conclusion, high intensity exercise, if energy matched, does not lead to greater appetite or energy intake but may exert additional beneficial metabolic effects that may be more pronounced in males.
To characterize retinal mitochondrial respiration associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) progression in a cone-rich diurnal rodent, the Nile rat (genus Arvicanthis, species niloticus).
Guidelines recommend corticosteroids in patients with IgA nephropathy and persistent proteinuria, but the effects remain uncertain.
To investigate whether differences in muscle fiber types affect early-stage fat accumulation, under high fat diet challenge in mice.
Given the public health significance of poorly treatable co-morbid major depressive disorders (MDD) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and coronary heart disease (CHD), we need to investigate whether strategies to prevent the development of major depression could reduce its burden of disease. We therefore evaluated the effectiveness of a stepped-care program for subthreshold depression in comparison with usual care in patients with DM2 and/or CHD.
Being overweight is an important risk factor for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Weight change between pregnancies has been suggested to be an independent mechanism behind GDM. We assessed the risk for GDM in second pregnancy by change in Body Mass Index (BMI) from first to second pregnancy and whether BMI and gestational weight gain modified the risk.
The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing globally. One hypothesis is that increasing childhood obesity rates may explain part of this increase, but, as T1D is rare, intervention studies are challenging to perform. The aim of this study was to assess this hypothesis with a Mendelian randomization approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to test for causal associations.
BACKGROUND Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a high incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and high sodium glucose co-transporters 2 (SGLT2) expressions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anticancer activity of dapagliflozin as an SGLT2 inhibitor on RCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect SGLT2 expression on different human renal cells. Then, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin on cell cycle, apoptosis, and SGLT2 expression of CaKi-1 cells. Finally, a xenograft model and immunohistochemical staining were used to investigate the function of dapagliflozin in nude mice. RESULTS We proved that SGLT2 is highly expressed in RCC cell lines. We found that dapagliflozin exerts a higher cytotoxic effect on human RCC than on normal human renal cells, regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis, and reduces the glucose uptake and SGLT2 expression of CaKi-1 cells. Moreover, dapagliflozin inhibits tumor growth and reduces SGLT2 expression in vivo. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that dapagliflozin has high efficiency and low toxicity and could be a new therapeutic target for RCC.
The present study assessed the predictive value of age and Modified Frailty Index (mFI) on the management of primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients aged 70 years or older (elderly).
The aim of this study was to determine how trial-based findings of EXCEL and NOBLE might be interpreted and generalizable in 'real-world' settings with comparison of data from the large-scaled, all-comer Interventional Research Incorporation Society-Left MAIN Revascularization (IRIS-MAIN) registry.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing partly due to the obesity epidemic. Adipocytokines have thus been suggested as first trimester screening markers for GDM. In this study we explore the associations between body mass index (BMI) and serum concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, and the adiponectin/leptin ratio. Furthermore, we investigate whether these markers can improve the ability to screen for GDM in the first trimester.
Diabetes results from an inadequate mass of functional beta cells, due to either beta�cell loss caused by autoimmune destruction (Type I diabetes) or beta cell failure in response to insulin resistance (Type II diabetes). Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate beta�cell mass may be key to developing new techniques that foster beta�cell regeneration as a cellular therapy to treat diabetes. While previous studies concluded that cyclin D2 is required for postnatal beta cell self-renewal in mice, it is not clear if cyclin D2 is sufficient to drive beta cell self-renewal. Using transgenic mice that overexpress cyclin D2 specifically in beta cells, we show that cyclin D2 overexpression increases beta cell self-renewal post-weaning and results in increased beta cell mass. Beta cells that overexpress cyclin D2 are responsive to glucose stimulation, suggesting they are functionally mature. Beta cells that overexpress cyclin D2 demonstrate an enhanced regenerative capacity after injury induced by streptozotocin toxicity. To understand if cyclin D2 overexpression is sufficient to drive beta cell self-renewal, we generated a novel mouse model where cyclin D2 is only expressed in beta cells of cyclin D2(-/-) mice. Transgenic overexpression of cyclin D2 in cyclin D2(-)(/)(-) beta cells was sufficient to restore beta cell mass, maintain normoglycaemia, and improve regenerative capacity when compared to cyclin D2(-/-) littermates. Taken together, our results indicate that cyclin D2 is sufficient to regulate beta cell self-renewal and that manipulation of its expression could be used to enhance beta cell regeneration.
Daily coffee consumption is inversely associated with risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D). Cafestol, a bioactive substance in coffee, increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro and increases glucose uptake in human skeletal muscle cells. We hypothesized that cafestol can postpone development of T2D in KKAy mice. Forty-seven male KKAy mice were randomized to consume chow supplemented daily with either 1.1 (high), 0.4 (low), or 0 (control) mg of cafestol for 10 weeks. We collected blood samples for fasting glucose, glucagon, and insulin as well as liver, muscle, and fat tissues for gene expression analysis. We isolated islets of Langerhans and measured insulin secretory capacity. After 10 weeks of intervention, fasting plasma glucose was 28-30% lower in cafestol groups compared with the control group (p < 0.01). Fasting glucagon was 20% lower and insulin sensitivity improved by 42% in the high-cafestol group (p < 0.05). Cafestol increased insulin secretion from isolated islets by 75-87% compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Our results show that cafestol possesses antidiabetic properties in KKAy mice. Consequently, cafestol may contribute to the reduced risk of developing T2D in coffee consumers and has a potential role as an antidiabetic drug.
Most guidelines provide people with Type 1 diabetes with pre- and post-meal capillary blood glucose (CBG) targets to achieve optimal glycaemic control. We evaluated the proportion of daily CBG readings between 4 and 10�mmol/l in people achieving different HbA1c levels.
The 99th percentile of cardiac troponin I level in the general population is accepted as the cut-off for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, it is not clear whether the cut-offs derived in racially and geographically different populations are applicable in Japan.
In addition to their lipid-lowering abilities, statins have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Increasing recent evidence suggests the possible role of pretreatment with statins in preventing or decreasing morbidity and mortality from infection. Diabetic foot infection (DFI) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to determine whether previous atorvastatin use is associated with reduced risk of DFI and better outcomes of these infections.
Satiety-signaling, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus play a pivotal role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Recent studies reported altered mitochondrial dynamics and decreased mitochondria- endoplasmic reticulum contacts in POMC neurons during diet-induced obesity. Since mitochondria play a crucial role in Ca(2+) signaling, we investigated whether obesity alters Ca(2+) handling of these neurons in mice. In diet-induced obesity, cellular Ca(2+) handling properties including mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake capacity are impaired, and an increased resting level of free intracellular Ca(2+) is accompanied by a marked decrease in neuronal excitability. Experimentally increasing or decreasing intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations reproduced electrophysiological properties observed in diet-induced obesity. Taken together, we provide the first direct evidence for a diet-dependent deterioration of Ca(2+) homeostasis in POMC neurons during obesity development resulting in impaired function of these critical energy homeostasis-regulating neurons.
This review summarizes the main provisions of the new, issued in 2016, recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and Atherosclerosis Society in cooperation with the European Association on Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation on Cardiovascular disease prevention and Management of dyslipidemia. In these recommendations, the following trends can be traced distinctly: priority in primary prevention is given to non-drug methods of influence; targets of hypolipidemic therapy are identified not only for low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (CH), but also for non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) CH, especially in cases of concomitant hypertriglyceridemia. In the field of therapy, in which statins remain the main tool of correction of hyperlipidemia, it is recommended to more widely resort to the use of combination therapy, especially in cases of familial hypercholesterolemia or intolerance to statins; introduction of a new class of drugs- inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 makes it possible to further reduce the level of LDLCH, lipoprotein(a) more than 60%. Regarding the wider application of these drugs there are issues related to the relatively limited experience of their use and the lack of data on long-term results and the incidence of side effects. Much attention is paid to more active correction of dyslipidemia in elderly patients, patients with chronic renal failure, diabetes, and several other diseases. The emergence of new European recommendations will undoubtedly serve as a stimulus to the revision of the Russian recommendations, which remain unchanged from 2012.
to determine risk factors of early cardiovascular complications after beating-heart coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with ischemic coronary disease (IHD) and type two diabetes (D2).
to study serum levels of vascular endothelium growth factor family peptides (VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGF-D) and functional gene polymorphisms of VEGFA gene (rs699947 and rs3025039) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) depending on the presence of ischemic heart disease (IHD).
Primary prevention of cardiovascular events is based on achievement of optimal control of risk factors - arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, glycemia - in accordance with current recommendations of scientific societies. But most rapidly growing segment of population - elderly and old individuals - have been underrepresented in randomized clinical trials underlying recommendations on primary and secondary prevention. That is why it is problematic to directly apply recommendations to patients from this group of population. In addition, old patients are characterized by accumulation of functional deficits, development of syndrome of senile asthenia ("frailty"), and multimorbidity. Effect of these characteristics on prognosis often exceeds that of risk factors. Other important factor is high susceptibility of old patients to risk of development of unfavorable effects because of both changes of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs and the need for multiple medicines (polypragmasy). While applying existing recommendations to old people one should recognize limitations of current knowledge on best ways of realization of approaches to prevention of cardiovascular prevention which effectiveness has been proved in younger individuals. Improvement of awareness and development of special skills of physicians involved in management of old patients is required for timely detection of the syndrome of senile asthenia. Special geriatric approaches should be implemented in cooperation with specialists in geriatric medicine.
